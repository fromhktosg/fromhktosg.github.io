  <li>
    <p><strong>Salted Egg</strong><br />
A bold savoury-sweet filling with a grainy texture — once a craze, now a mainstay.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ondeh-Ondeh</strong><br />
Inspired by the traditional green kueh, these donuts are stuffed with gula melaka and rolled in shredded coconut.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Durian</strong><br />
Love it or hate it, durian donuts are packed with pungent pride. A bold choice for adventurous taste buds.</p>

<h2 id="western-vs-local-preferences">Western vs. Local Preferences</h2>

<p>Western donuts typically come filled with vanilla cream, chocolate, or fruity jelly. But here in Singapore, the flavours lean local — pandan, salted egg, and Milo rule the display cases.</p>

<p>Tourists may reach for a sugar-coated classic, but locals know the good stuff hides behind labels like <em>kaya</em> or <em>ondeh-ondeh</em>. It’s a delicious example of how global formats adapt to local flavour identities.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
