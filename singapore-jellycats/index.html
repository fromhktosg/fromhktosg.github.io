				<p>Jellycat Singapore fans, rejoice—your favorite irresistibly soft and quirky plush toys are more popular than ever.</p>

<p>Originally from London, Jellycat has taken the world by storm, proving that stuffed toys aren’t just for kids. Adults, too, have fallen for these cuddly companions, whether for stress relief, aesthetic appeal, or just an excuse to collect yet another plushie. From classic Bashful Bunnies to the latest Amuseable Avocado, there’s always a new Jellycat to obsess over. If you’re wondering where to buy Jellycats in Singapore—or even looking for budget-friendly alternatives—we’ve got you covered.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-jellycats">What are jellycats?</h3>

<p>Jellycats are premium plush toys known for their unbelievably soft texture, quirky designs, and high-quality craftsmanship. They come in a variety of shapes and characters, from adorable animals to playful food items, making them a favorite among collectors of all ages. Unlike generic stuffed toys, Jellycats have a distinct charm—whether it’s their floppy limbs, endearing expressions, or the sheer huggability that makes them hard to put down. They’ve gained a cult following not just for their cuteness but also for their luxurious feel, often described as “the softest plush you’ll ever touch.” Whether you’re looking for a comforting bedtime companion or just another plushie to add to your growing collection, Jellycats have a way of sneaking into your heart (and onto your shelves).</p>

<h3 id="origin-of-jellycats">Origin of jellycats</h3>

<p>Jellycat was founded in London in 1999 by brothers Thomas and William Gatacre, who wanted to create plush toys that were both irresistibly soft and uniquely quirky. The brand’s unusual name came from a child’s playful mashup of two favorite things—jelly and cats—setting the tone for the whimsical and imaginative designs that followed. From the beginning, the Gatacre brothers focused on quality and creativity, crafting plushies that felt luxurious and looked delightfully different from typical stuffed toys. Their early designs featured playful textures, floppy limbs, and unexpected characters, breaking away from the traditional teddy bear mold. As demand grew, Jellycat expanded its lineup with more charming and eccentric plushies, turning a small passion project into a global phenomenon loved by collectors of all ages.</p>
