				<p>In an earlier post, we touched on the Singapore education system versus Hong Kong’s education system. In today’s post, we’ll discuss the International Baccalaureate (IB) program specifically. This rigorous two-year diploma program, emphasizing critical thinking and global perspectives, is now offered at leading institutions like Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and St. Joseph’s Institution International. While the IB’s inquiry-based approach differs from Singapore’s structured local system, both paths offer distinct challenges and opportunities for academic excellence, making the choice less about difficulty and more about finding the right educational fit. Let’s dive in.</p>

<h3 id="singapore-education-system">Singapore education system</h3>

<p>Singapore’s local education system follows a structured pathway that begins with six years of primary education, culminating in the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). This national examination is a crucial milestone that determines students’ placement in secondary schools through a merit-based posting system. The primary curriculum emphasizes core subjects including English, Mother Tongue languages, Mathematics, and Science, with a strong focus on building fundamental knowledge and skills.
Following primary school, students enter secondary education where they are streamed into different academic tracks - Express, Normal (Academic), or Normal (Technical) - based on their PSLE results. The Express stream leads to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level examinations after four years, while the Normal streams typically take five years to complete their secondary education. This system, while often criticized for its high-stakes testing and academic pressure, has consistently produced strong outcomes in international assessments and is credited with contributing to Singapore’s economic success through the development of a skilled workforce.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ib">What is IB?</h3>

<p>The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme is a globally recognized pre-university qualification designed for students aged 16-19. Established in 1968 in Geneva, Switzerland, the program has evolved from its original purpose of serving globally mobile students to become a highly respected curriculum emphasizing both academic excellence and personal development.
The program’s structure revolves around three core elements: Theory of Knowledge (TOK), which explores the nature of knowledge; the Extended Essay, a 4,000-word independent research paper; and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS), which promotes holistic development through extracurricular engagement. Students must also study six subjects across different groups, with three at Higher Level and three at Standard Level.</p>

<p>Assessment in the IB is comprehensive, combining continuous evaluation through presentations, research papers, and projects with final external examinations. Students can earn up to 45 points, with 42 from their six subjects and 3 bonus points from TOK and Extended Essay. The program emphasizes critical thinking, international-mindedness, and research skills, preparing students effectively for university education.</p>

<p>Universities worldwide value the IB Diploma highly, often offering advanced standing or credit to graduates. The program’s demanding nature helps develop crucial skills like time management, critical analysis, and independent research. However, it comes with challenges, including a substantial workload and higher costs due to teacher training and program administration requirements.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, the IB continues to grow in popularity globally, including in Singapore. Its success in preparing students for higher education while developing well-rounded individuals has established it as a leading pre-university qualification. The program offers more than just academic preparation – it provides a transformative educational experience that develops critical thinking, research capabilities, and global awareness.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-more-and-more-people-taking-ib-in-singapore">Why are more and more people taking IB in Singapore?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The growing demand for international education has led many Singapore families to consider IB as a pathway that offers greater global mobility and recognition, particularly for students planning to study abroad at top universities in the US, UK, and Europe.</li>
  <li>The IB’s inquiry-based learning approach and emphasis on critical thinking appeals to parents who prefer a more holistic education system over Singapore’s traditionally exam-focused curriculum, believing it better prepares students for the evolving demands of the modern workforce.</li>
  <li>Singapore’s increasing role as a global hub has brought more expatriate families and returning Singaporeans who are familiar with or prefer international curricula, driving demand for IB programs across the island.</li>
  <li>The success of established Singapore schools offering IB, such as Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and School of the Arts (SOTA), has helped build confidence in the program’s ability to deliver strong academic outcomes while maintaining high standards comparable to the local system.</li>
  <li>The IB’s focus on developing well-rounded individuals through mandatory components like Theory of Knowledge and Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) resonates with parents who want their children to develop soft skills and global perspectives alongside academic excellence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="schools-that-offer-ib">Schools that offer IB</h3>

<p>Local Schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) - One of Singapore’s most prestigious schools offering the IB Diploma Programme</li>
  <li>St. Joseph’s Institution - Offers both A-levels and IB tracks</li>
  <li>School of the Arts Singapore (SOTA) - Specializes in arts education alongside the IB curriculum</li>
</ul>

<p>International Schools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA) - Both East and Dover campuses</li>
  <li>Tanglin Trust School - British-based international school with strong IB results</li>
  <li>Canadian International School - Two campuses offering IB from primary to diploma</li>
  <li>Singapore American School - One of the largest international schools in Singapore</li>
  <li>St. Joseph’s Institution International - Sister school to the local SJI</li>
  <li>Stamford American International School - Offers both IB and American AP programs</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Schools are listed based on factors including program establishment, size, and recognition. Annual fees vary significantly between local schools (approximately SGD 300-1,500 per month) and international schools (approximately SGD 2,500-4,500 per month).</p>

<h3 id="average-ib-scores-for-singapore">Average IB scores for Singapore</h3>

<p>Singapore consistently excels in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme, with students achieving well above the global average. Here’s an overview of performance by school type:</p>

<p>Local Schools: Local schools typically outperform international schools in average IB scores. For instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent): Average score above 41 points, with multiple students achieving the perfect score of 45.</li>
  <li>Hwa Chong International School: Frequently reports scores above 40 points.</li>
</ul>

<p>International Schools: International schools also perform well but generally have slightly lower averages compared to local schools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tanglin Trust School: Average score of 39.1 points.</li>
  <li>Dulwich College (Singapore): Average score of 37.6 points.</li>
  <li>Overseas Family School (OFS): Average score of 35 points.</li>
  <li>NPS International School: Average score of 38.1 points.</li>
  <li>Many international schools cater to a broader range of students, including those new to the IB curriculum, which may impact average scores.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I’d recommend IB as a way to shift away from the harsher local curriculum and to have a more recognized gateway into international. Let me know what you guys think though.
