				<p>Bubble tea or milk tea in Singapore is more than just a drink—it’s practically a lifestyle.</p>

<p>From classic milk tea with chewy tapioca pearls to extravagant cheese foam-topped creations, Singaporeans can’t seem to get enough of their favorite boba fix. But how did this obsession even begin, and is it really called “bubble tea” or “boba”? With so many tea bases, toppings, and sugar levels to choose from, navigating the bubble tea world can feel overwhelming, especially with new brands like Chagee gaining cult followings. Whether you’re just here for the pearls or secretly wondering if opening your own bubble tea shop is a good investment, this guide will cover everything you need to know about Singapore’s unshakable love for bubble tea.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-singaporeans-like-bubble-tea">Why do Singaporeans like bubble tea?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Convenience: Bubble tea is easily accessible with numerous outlets in <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/shopping-in-singapore/">shopping malls</a>, along MRT stations, and even on food delivery apps.</li>
  <li>Customizable: With endless options for tea bases, sugar levels, and toppings (like pearls, coconut jelly, or red bean), there’s something for everyone.</li>
  <li>Social Media Appeal: Instagram-worthy drinks and quirky flavors make bubble tea a fun part of Singapore’s social media culture.</li>
  <li>Chewy Pearls: The satisfying texture of the chewy tapioca pearls adds a unique experience that sets bubble tea apart from regular beverages.</li>
  <li>Trendy and Youthful: It’s seen as a trendy, youthful drink, and often associated with socializing or hanging out with friends.</li>
  <li>Cultural Influence: Having originated in Taiwan, bubble tea has become a beloved part of the Singaporean food scene due to its influence across Asia.</li>
  <li>Sweet Escape: A sugary, refreshing treat that offers a quick break from the daily grind, satisfying cravings for something indulgent.</li>
  <li>Affordable luxury: Not the cheapest, not essential either</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-did-the-bubble-tea-craze-start">How did the bubble tea craze start?</h3>

<p>The bubble tea craze began in Taiwan during the 1980s, with the invention of the now-famous drink made from tea, milk, and chewy tapioca pearls. Legend has it that Lin Hsiu Hui, the owner of a small tea shop, decided to add tapioca pearls to her iced tea, creating a unique combination that quickly gained popularity. By the 1990s, bubble tea made its way to other parts of Asia, including Singapore, where it rapidly became a hit. The trend was fueled by its novelty, customizable nature, and the fun of slurping up chewy pearls with every sip. Over time, social media amplified the craze, making bubble tea a global sensation that continues to thrive today.</p>

<p>Bubble tea made its way into Singapore in the early 1990s, shortly after it gained popularity in Taiwan. The first shops offering the trendy drink started popping up, initially catering to the younger crowd who were curious about the novelty of combining tea with chewy tapioca pearls. Singapore’s food scene, already known for embracing new trends, quickly embraced bubble tea, with local adaptations of flavors and toppings. The growing influence of Taiwanese pop culture, along with the rise of malls and food courts, created the perfect environment for bubble tea chains to expand rapidly. Soon, it wasn’t just a passing fad but a lasting part of Singapore’s daily life, with local and international brands competing for the top spot in a fiercely popular market. Allegedly, Koi came first to SG.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-boba-or-bubble-tea">Is it boba or bubble tea?</h3>

<p>Whether it’s called boba or bubble tea often depends on where you’re from, but both terms refer to the same popular drink. Bubble tea is the more common name in places like Singapore and the U.S., highlighting the tea base and the chewy “bubbles” or pearls that sit at the bottom of the drink. On the other hand, boba is the term used primarily in Taiwan, where the drink originated, and it’s often used interchangeably to describe the drink and the tapioca pearls themselves. So, if you’re craving that sweet, chewy, Instagram-worthy drink, you can call it whatever you like—whether you’re enjoying a boba milk tea or a bubble tea with pearls, you’re in for a treat.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-pearls-or-bubbles-made-of-for-bubble-tea">What are the pearls or bubbles made of for bubble tea?</h3>

<p>The pearls or bubbles in bubble tea are typically made from tapioca starch, water, and sugar, which are cooked to create chewy, translucent balls. Some variations may use other ingredients like agar or fruit juices for different textures and flavors.</p>

<h3 id="is-bubble-tea-healthy">Is bubble tea healthy?</h3>

<p>Bubble tea can be high in sugar and calories, especially with added toppings like tapioca pearls or cheese foam. While it provides some antioxidants from the tea, regular consumption may not be the healthiest choice due to its sugar content. Opting for lower sugar versions or healthier toppings can make it a more balanced treat.</p>

<h3 id="what-types-of-tea-are-there-for-bubble-tea">What types of tea are there for bubble tea?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Green Tea / Sencha: A lighter, more refreshing option, often used in healthier bubble tea variations.</li>
  <li>Oolong Tea: A semi-fermented tea that provides a unique, floral flavor profile.</li>
  <li>Jasmine Tea: A fragrant, floral tea that pairs well with sweet toppings like tapioca pearls.</li>
  <li>Taro Tea: A sweet, creamy tea made with taro root, popular in bubble tea for its smooth texture and unique flavor.</li>
  <li>Matcha Tea: A powdered green tea used for a richer, more earthy taste in bubble tea.</li>
  <li>Ceylon Tea: A bold, robust tea from Sri Lanka that adds a rich flavor to bubble tea.</li>

<p>Of course, all of these can come with milk or without. In some instances, they can be with fruits as well.</p>

<h3 id="what-type-of-toppings-are-there-for-bubble-tea">What type of toppings are there for bubble tea?</h3>

<h3 id="can-you-make-bubble-tea-at-home">Can you make bubble tea at home?</h3>

<p>Yes, here’s how:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tea Base: Brew your favorite tea (green, black, oolong, etc.). For a more authentic taste, use loose leaf tea or tea bags.</li>
  <li>Tapioca Pearls: You can either buy pre-made tapioca pearls from stores or make your own from scratch (though that’s a more time-consuming process). Simply cook them according to the package instructions.</li>
  <li>Sweetener: Add your preferred sweetener—sugar syrup, honey, or brown sugar syrup—depending on your taste.</li>
  <li>Milk or Alternatives: Add regular milk, condensed milk, or dairy-free alternatives like almond milk or oat milk for a creamy texture.</li>
  <li>Ice: Add ice cubes to chill your bubble tea.</li>
  <li>Toppings: If you like extra toppings like coconut jelly, popping boba, or red bean, you can easily add them in!</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me save you some time though - it’s not worth the time unless for a fun date idea.</p>

<p>I’m not crazy about milk tea or bubble tea. It’s really not that healthy and dents your wallet like a daily coffee does. Let me know your thoughts.</p>
