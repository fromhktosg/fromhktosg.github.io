				<p>Dumplings in Singapore are more than just a comfort food—they’re a cultural staple, a festive favourite, and a daily craving for many across the island.</p>

<p>Whether you’re searching for the best dumplings in Singapore, craving same-day dumpling delivery, or curious about handmade or halal dumpling options, there’s a flavour and filling for every taste bud. From juicy pork xiao long bao to crispy fried gyoza, and even frozen dumplings for quick home meals, Singapore offers it all. And with Chinese New Year just around the corner, dumplings become not just food, but a symbol of luck and prosperity. Let’s explore where to find the best dumplings in Singapore, how to get them delivered, and what makes each variety special.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-dumplings">What are dumplings?</h3>

<p>Dumplings are small pieces of dough wrapped around a filling—or sometimes just dough on its own—usually cooked by boiling, steaming, frying, or baking. They appear in many cultures, but in Chinese cuisine (where they’re most famously known), dumplings typically include fillings like minced pork, shrimp, vegetables, or a mix of ingredients, all encased in thin wheat flour wrappers.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-dumplings-originate-from">Where do dumplings originate from?</h3>

<p>Dumplings originated in China over 1,800 years ago, with the most famous origin story tracing back to Zhang Zhongjing, a Chinese medicine practitioner from the Eastern Han Dynasty. He reportedly invented dumplings to help villagers fend off frostbite by filling dough wrappers with meat and warming herbs, then boiling them into nourishing parcels.</p>

<p>From there, dumplings spread across regions and dynasties, evolving into countless forms across Asia—like Japanese gyoza, Korean mandu, and Tibetan momos. Each variation adapted to local ingredients and culinary preferences, but the core idea remained: a comforting, versatile dish often associated with festivals and family gatherings.</p>

<p>In Singapore, dumplings arrived primarily through Chinese immigrants, particularly the Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, and Hakka communities, who brought their own styles and recipes during the 19th and early 20th centuries. These communities settled across the island, setting up eateries and hawker stalls that eventually made dumplings a beloved part of Singapore’s multicultural food scene. Today, you’ll find everything from traditional jiaozi to modern truffle xiao long bao in both high-end restaurants and heartland food courts.</p>
