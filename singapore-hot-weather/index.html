				<p>Why is Singapore so hot? If you’ve ever stepped outside and felt like you were swimming through the air, you’re not alone.</p>

<p>Singapore’s hot weather is a year-round affair, thanks to its location near the equator, high humidity, and complete lack of seasons—yes, it’s summer all the time. But how does Singapore’s climate compare to other hot countries, and is there a risk of temperatures going even higher in the future? Before you start planning a personal air-conditioning bubble, we’ll explore why Singapore is so humid, how hot it gets across different months, and some crazy ideas to keep the country cool. And if you’re already melting, check out our previous article for the best tips and tricks to survive Singapore’s never-ending heatwave.</p>

<h3 id="how-hot-does-singapore-get-across-months">How hot does Singapore get across months?</h3>

<p>Singapore is consistently hot year-round, with average temperatures hovering between 24°C to 34°C (75°F to 93°F). Rainfall varies by month, but thanks to the country’s humid tropical climate, expect frequent showers no matter when you visit. Here’s a month-by-month breakdown:</p>

<p>So, whether it’s January or June, Singapore’s heat is relentless—but at least there’s air-conditioning everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-singapore-so-hot">Why is Singapore so hot?</h3>

<p>Singapore is so hot because it sits almost directly on the equator, meaning the sun is practically overhead all year long. Unlike places with four seasons, Singapore doesn’t get a break—no winter, no cool autumn breeze, just endless summer. The country’s high humidity (often above 80%) makes it feel even hotter, trapping heat like a sticky, invisible blanket. Plus, urbanization and the heat island effect from all the concrete and buildings make things worse, keeping the city warm even at night. And if you’re hoping for a sudden cold spell—sorry, the only ice you’ll find is in your bubble tea.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-singapore-not-have-seasons">Why does Singapore not have seasons?</h3>

<p>Same reasons as above. Singapore doesn’t have seasons because it’s located near the equator, where the sun’s position and temperature stay consistent year-round.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-singapores-temperatures-rank-versus-other-hot-countries">How does Singapore’s temperatures rank versus other hot countries?</h3>

<p>Singapore is consistently hot, but it’s not the hottest place on Earth. Compared to desert regions like Death Valley, USA (up to 56.7°C) or Kuwait (over 50°C in summer), Singapore’s 34°C max might seem mild. However, what makes Singapore unbearable is the humidity, which pushes the heat index (feels-like temperature) past 40°C. Among tropical cities, Singapore ranks alongside Jakarta, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur, but its urban heat island effect makes it feel hotter than many of them, especially at night. So while you won’t fry an egg on the pavement, you’ll definitely sweat through your shirt in minutes.</p>

<h3 id="tips-to-stay-cool-in-the-heat">Tips to stay cool in the heat</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wear light, breathable clothing – Stick to loose, moisture-wicking fabrics like cotton or linen to stay comfortable.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated – Drink plenty of water (or iced kopi, no judgment) to prevent dehydration and overheating.</li>
  <li>Seek air-conditioning – Malls, MRT stations, and underground walkways are your best friends in Singapore’s heat.</li>
  <li>Avoid the midday sun – The sun is strongest between 11 AM – 3 PM, so plan outdoor activities in the morning or evening.</li>
  <li>Use cooling products – Carry a portable fan, cooling wipes, or even a mist spray to survive Singapore’s never-ending sauna.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-weather/">previous article</a> to learn more about these tips and tricks.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-risk-of-temperatures-going-higher-in-the-future-in-singapore">Is there a risk of temperatures going higher in the future in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Singapore’s temperatures are expected to rise due to climate change and urbanization. Global warming is pushing up temperatures worldwide, and Singapore’s urban heat island effect (all that concrete trapping heat) makes it worse. The government projects that by 2100, average temperatures could rise by 4°C, meaning 35°C+ days could become the norm. Increased humidity will also make the “feels-like” temperature even more unbearable. So yes, it’s already hot—but the future might be even hotter.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-cause-higher-temperatures-in-singapore">What would cause higher temperatures in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Higher temperatures in Singapore would be caused by a mix of climate change and urbanization. Global warming is driving up temperatures worldwide, leading to more extreme heat. The urban heat island effect—where concrete, glass, and asphalt trap and radiate heat—makes Singapore even warmer, especially at night. Deforestation in and around the region also reduces natural cooling, while increasing carbon emissions from industries and transport worsen the problem. And if that’s not enough, rising sea levels could lead to more humid conditions, making the heat feel even more unbearable.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-singapore-best-adapt-for-higher-temperatures">How can Singapore best adapt for higher temperatures?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Increase green spaces – Plant more trees, create green roofs, and develop more parks to cool the environment.</li>
  <li>Implement cooling infrastructure – Use reflective surfaces, smart water features, and energy-efficient materials in urban design.</li>
  <li>Promote energy-efficient buildings – Encourage sustainable architecture to reduce heat absorption and lower energy consumption.</li>
  <li>Expand public transportation – Reduce car usage and lower emissions through better, more accessible public transit.</li>
  <li>Improve water management – Enhance drainage and flood prevention systems to cope with extreme weather.</li>
  <li>Invest in climate-resilient technologies – Focus on innovations that help mitigate the effects of heat and climate change.</li>
  <li>Educate the public – Raise awareness on sustainable practices and how to adapt to the changing climate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crazy-ideas-to-keep-singapore-cool">Crazy ideas to keep Singapore cool</h3>

<p>Here are some crazy (but maybe genius) ideas to keep Singapore cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Giant air-conditioned domes – Just cover the whole city like Gardens by the Bay and blast the AC. Problem solved.</li>
  <li>Floating icebergs in Marina Bay – Tug some ice from Antarctica and let it melt slowly for a natural cooling effect.</li>
  <li>Underground Singapore 2.0 – Build an entire underground city where it’s always cool, and never step outside again.</li>
  <li>Massive misting systems – Turn every lamppost into a fine mist sprayer so stepping outside feels like walking through a cooling cloud.</li>
  <li>Heat-reflecting skyscrapers – Cover buildings in reflective materials to bounce heat away—bonus if they double as giant solar panels.</li>
  <li>Artificial rain-on-demand – Control the clouds and make it rain whenever temperatures hit unbearable levels.</li>
  <li>Citywide ice baths – Free public ice baths at MRT stations—because desperate times call for refreshing measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these may sound ridiculous, but hey, Singapore already air-conditions its bus stops, so anything is possible!</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>
