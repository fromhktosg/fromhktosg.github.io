<h4 id="signature-furniture-stores">Signature furniture stores</h4>

<p>If you’re in the market for some designer furniture, look no further than the hip neighborhood of <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/neighbourhood/">Tiong Bahru</a>. Here, you’ll find a range of stylish boutiques offering modern and contemporary furniture designs. At <a href="https://www.grafunkt.com/">Grafunkt</a>, you’ll find sleek, minimalist pieces that blend form and function seamlessly. Meanwhile, at <a href="https://www.thecommunelife.com/">Commune</a>, you’ll find a range of chic and affordable furniture made from sustainable materials. For a touch of Japanese charm, head over to <a href="https://www.muji.com/sg/products/list/Furniture%20and%20Interior">Muji</a>, where you’ll find simple and elegant furniture designs that are both stylish and functional.</p>

<p>If you’re on a budget, don’t despair. Singapore is also home to a range of value furniture stores. One such store is <a href="https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIt8SC-Ly__gIVVnV9Ch1SwAhGEAAYASAAEgLBdfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IKEA</a>, which needs no introduction. At IKEA, you’ll find a range of affordable furniture pieces that are both stylish and functional. Alternatively, head over to <a href="https://www.furnituresg.com.sg/">FurnitureSG</a>, where you’ll find a range of affordable furniture options that are perfect for furnishing your new home.</p>

<p>For those who prefer a more vintage aesthetic, Singapore also has a range of charming vintage stores. At <a href="https://www.hocksiong.com.sg/">Hock Siong &amp; Co.</a>, you’ll find a range of unique vintage furniture pieces, as well as quirky vintage decor and accessories. Last but not least, the <a href="http://www.tanboonliat.com/">Tan Boon Liat building</a>. The Tan Boon Liat Building is a commercial building located in the Outram area of Singapore. It is known as a hub for furniture showrooms and interior design businesses. The building has a rich history, having been built in the 1930s and originally serving as a warehouse for Chinese goods. In recent years, it has become a popular destination for those looking to shop for furniture, with a wide range of options available from high-end designer pieces to more affordable selections. Some of these stores require reservations ahead of time so remember to call in advance!</p>

<h4 id="what-to-watch-out-for-when-buying-furniture">What to watch out for when buying furniture</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Quality - Make sure that the furniture you are purchasing is made of high-quality materials and is built to last. Look for solid wood construction (especially for wardrobes), sturdy joints, and high-quality finishes.</li>
  <li>Comfort - Test out chairs, sofas, sofa beds, and mattresses to make sure that they are comfortable and provide adequate support.</li>
  <li>Size and Scale - When buying furniture, it’s important to consider the size and scale of the piece in relation to the room it will be placed in. A large, bulky sofa may look great in a showroom, but it may overwhelm a small living room. Make sure that the furniture you are purchasing fits the space and complements the other pieces in the room.</li>
  <li>Functionality - Consider how the furniture will be used and whether it is functional for your needs. For example, if you have children or pets, you may want to opt for furniture that is easy to clean and durable. If you work from home, you may need a desk or office chair that provides adequate support for long periods of sitting.</li>
  <li>Price - Price is always a consideration when making a purchase, but it’s important to balance price with quality. While you may be tempted to opt for cheaper furniture, it may end up costing you more in the long run if it needs to be replaced frequently. Consider investing in higher-quality pieces that will last for years to come.</li>
  <li>Delivery and Assembly - Finally, consider the logistics of getting the furniture to your home. Make sure that the store offers delivery and assembly services and factor these costs into your budget</li>
  <li>Vibe - Make sure your furniture pieces complement each other. Getting an ID can always help with this</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="my-favourite-places-to-buy-furniture">My favourite places to buy furniture</h4>

<p>My furniture combination arises from these stores. Most if not all of these do delivery and assembly so no need to fret if you cannot wield a screwdriver.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Castlery - simple and modern</li>
  <li>Crate and barrel - quality furniture at mid to aspirational price points (now closed in Apr 2023)</li>
  <li>Harvey Norman - surprising discovery given its usually associated with electronic products. Harvey Norman does provide a solid selection of furniture and often throws in bulk purchasing discounts</li>
  <li>Ikea - good ol’ Ikea. The mecca of furniture stores. No one can deny their affordability and tasty swedish meatballs</li>
</ul>
