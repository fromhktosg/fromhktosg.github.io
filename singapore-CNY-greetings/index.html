				<p>This week in Chinese new year - we wrote about it in an earlier article. Chinese New Year in Singapore isn’t just about feasting and collecting ang baos—it’s also the season of bai nian (拜年), where you visit relatives, exchange auspicious greetings, and try to remember who’s who in the extended family.</p>

<p>It’s a time-honored tradition where people make the rounds, armed with well-rehearsed blessings, hoping for good fortune (or at least a bigger red packet). But what exactly do you say when bai nian? What should you be eating to keep the festive spirit alive? And, most importantly, what unwritten rules should you absolutely not break? This guide will take you through the art of bai nian—from the greetings to the food and customs—so you can navigate the season like a pro (or at least not embarrass yourself).</p>

<h3 id="why-do-people-bai-nian拜年">Why do people ‘bai nian’拜年?</h3>

<p>When it comes to bai nian (拜年), not all visits are created equal—there’s a hierarchy to follow. The most important people on your list? Elders, starting with grandparents, parents, and senior relatives, because filial piety is everything (and also where the best ang baos come from). The first two days of Chinese New Year, Chu Yi (初一) and Chu Er (初二), are reserved for immediate and extended family, as these are the days you honor your elders and keep the family spirit alive. Married couples are next, as they are morally obligated to distribute red packets to the unmarried, which makes them prime targets for strategic visits. Close friends and colleagues also exchange festive greetings, though usually without the monetary incentives. And if you’re really committed, some even bai nian to bosses or business partners, because what better way to start the year than ensuring good office politics and future pay raises?</p>

<p>And then there are the unexpected bai nian interactions—the security guards at your condo or office, the neighborhood kopitiam uncle, and even your regular bubble tea cashier, because why not spread some extra goodwill (or subtly hint at better service for the rest of the year)? Some overachievers even bring mandarin oranges for these encounters, just to flex their festive etiquette.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-people-say-when-bai-nian-your-chinese-new-year-greetings-cheat-sheet">What do people say when ‘bai nian’? Your chinese New Year Greetings cheat sheet</h3>

<p>When you’re bai nian (拜年), it’s all about the greetings. Here’s a list of some of the most common phrases people exchange, depending on who they’re visiting (and whether they’re hoping for good fortune or just ang baos):</p>

<ul>
  <li>新春快乐 (Xīnchūn kuàilè) – Happy New Year! The classic, because everyone likes a fresh start.</li>
  <li>恭喜发财 (Gōngxǐ fācái) – Wishing you wealth and prosperity! The go-to for anyone you want to see more of during the year—especially when it comes to red packets.</li>
  <li>年年有余 (Nián nián yǒu yú) – May you have abundance every year. A lovely sentiment that’s basically a wish for never-ending fortune.</li>
  <li>身体健康 (Shēntǐ jiànkāng) – Wishing you good health. Because let’s face it, you can never have too much of that, especially after all those festive snacks.</li>
  <li>万事如意 (Wànshì rúyì) – May everything go as you wish. A nice all-rounder to wish success in life, work, and, perhaps, a little luck with that lottery ticket.</li>
  <li>大吉大利 (Dà jí dà lì) – Wishing you great luck and great profits. Perfect for anyone who’s in business—or anyone who enjoys a bit of self-interest!</li>
  <li>财源广进 (Cáiyuán guǎng jìn) – May wealth come in from all directions. For those who are really, really hoping for a year of financial windfalls.</li>
  <li>步步高升 (Bù bù gāo shēng) – May you rise higher with each step. Ideal for that cousin who’s still climbing the career ladder, or anyone who enjoys a bit of professional flattery.</li>
  <li>合家欢乐 (Hé jiā huān lè) – Wishing happiness to your entire family. For when you want to keep the peace with everyone in the room—especially those relatives you barely know.</li>
  <li>吉祥如意 (Jíxiáng rúyì) – May good fortune and all things auspicious be with you. The wish you toss around when you want to sound extra formal or impress that auntie who knows how to make all the right moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>These phrases are the key to mastering the fine art of bai nian, ensuring your visits are filled with luck, laughter, and maybe just a bit more red packet generosity. Wait a minute. Here’s more in case you need them!</p>

<p>Here are 10 more Chinese New Year greetings to make sure you’re totally equipped for the festive rounds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>一帆风顺 (Yī fān fēng shùn) – Wishing you smooth sailing. A nice way to wish someone an easy and trouble-free year ahead.</li>
  <li>心想事成 (Xīn xiǎng shì chéng) – May all your wishes come true. A classic that works for anyone, no matter what their “wishes” might be.</li>
  <li>财运亨通 (Cái yùn hēng tōng) – May you have good financial luck. This one’s great for those looking to boost their bank accounts—or subtly nudge the person you’re talking to.</li>
  <li>吉星高照 (Jíxīng gāo zhào) – May the lucky stars shine brightly on you. A stellar (pun intended) greeting to wish someone a year of unshakable fortune.</li>
  <li>大展鸿图 (Dà zhǎn hóng tú) – May your career and ambitions flourish. Best used for the go-getters in your life—those who are constantly chasing after bigger dreams.</li>
  <li>龙马精神 (Lóng mǎ jīng shén) – Wishing you strength and vitality like a dragon or horse. A great way to wish someone energy and resilience in their pursuits.
六六大顺 (Liù liù dà shùn) – Wishing you everything goes smoothly in all aspects of life. You know, just to cover all bases—life, love, work, and whatever else may pop up.</li>
  <li>生意兴隆 (Shēng yì xīng lóng) – May your business prosper. If you’re talking to an entrepreneur or someone with a side hustle, this one’s practically a must.</li>
  <li>天天开心 (Tiāntiān kāixīn) – May you be happy every day. For the people who live for joy and laughter—because who doesn’t want to be happy all year long?</li>
  <li>和气生财 (Hé qì shēng cái) – Harmony brings wealth. A gentle reminder that good relationships and peace in the home can lead to good fortune.</li>
</ul>

<p>With these 20 greetings under your belt, you’ll definitely impress (or at least, mildly entertain) all those you’re visiting for bai nian. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll find yourself the recipient of a well-timed red packet or two.</p>

<p>And how about some snake related ones too?!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>蛇年大吉 (Shé nián dà jí) – Wishing you great luck in the Year of the Snake.
Perfect for anyone born in the Year of the Snake, or anyone just looking to tie in some snake symbolism for good measure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>蛇行天下 (Shé xíng tiā xià) – May you conquer the world like a snake slithering through all obstacles.
This one’s for those who aim to glide through life with ease—smooth, like a snake.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>蛇精灵巧 (Shé jīng líng qiǎo) – May you be as clever and resourceful as a snake.
A good greeting for the smart and strategic thinkers in your circle, especially for those who always seem to have a trick up their sleeve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>蛇年发财 (Shé nián fā cái) – May you make a fortune in the Year of the Snake.
Because if there’s one thing a snake is known for, it’s knowing when to strike—so why not strike big with wealth?</p>

A general snake-themed blessing for anyone celebrating the year, perfect for spreading some fortune.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-people-eat-when-bai-nian">What do people eat when bai nian?</h3>

<p>When bai nian (拜年), food is a key part of the celebration, as you can’t just go around wishing people good luck without some delicious treats to back it up. Here’s what you’ll typically find on the table:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Radish Cake (萝卜糕) – A savory steamed cake made from radish and rice flour – Often served in bite-sized squares, it’s a popular dish during Chinese New Year, especially when fried for extra crispiness.</li>
