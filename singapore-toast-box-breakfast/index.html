			<div class="article-post serif-font">
				<p>Lately, I’ve been receiving numerous questions about the culinary scene in Singapore and my favorite go-to restaurants. I’ve always considered myself someone with a refined palate, and I’ve never quite found satisfaction in the recommendations from Google Maps, local Singaporeans, or local food blogs and YouTube channels. Therefore, I’ve made the decision to curate my own list for all you epicureans out there.</p>

<h4 id="some-ground-rules">Some ground rules</h4>

<p>As a reminder, this isn’t a fine dining list for 2 reasons - 1) it’s quite challenging to categorize the types of cuisine it covers, and 2) fine dining is never really a go-to option for food for anyone. I’ll share my list of fine dining recommendations at a later day. Additionally, we’ll exclude ‘Singaporean cuisine’ from this list as it deserves its own spotlight at another time. For certain cuisines, I don’t have a go-to choice as I don’t often have cravings for them. This includes Indian, Peranakan, Mala, etc., so they will also be omitted. These recommendations span across various price points. Keep in mind that this is my personal go-to list when I have specific cravings for a particular cuisine. If you have any recommendations, feel free to share them with me! I’d love to know your go-to places as well.</p>

<h5 id="western">Western</h5>

<p><u>Italian<u></u></u></p>

<p>Many italian restaurants are across the island. Most are tasty but way over price. Below are the ones that I find are value</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Menu ($$$): Experience authentic Italian cuisine complemented by excellent service and ambiance. True to its name, you can request dishes not listed on the menu. I personally recommend trying their seafood risotto and lobster ravioli.</li>
  <li>Publico ($$): A vibrant al fresco restaurant situated in the heart of Robertson Quay, perfect for brunch enthusiasts. I’m a fan of their shakshuka and pasta dishes. It’s an ideal spot for a mid-day drink.</li>
  <li>Pasta Bar ($$$): Indulge in high-quality, fresh pasta dishes in the heart of the city. This is my top choice for seafood pasta in Singapore, thanks to their exceptionally fresh ingredients and al dente pasta</li>
  <li>Ristorante Takada ($$$): Italian Japanese fusion. High value</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/images/pasta.jpg" alt="pasta" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Ristorante Takada’s signature uni pasta - incredible umami</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u>Mediterranean<u></u></u></p>

<p>Mediterranean is not the most common in Singapore but for the establishments below, they execute on their respective dishes well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blu Kouzina ($$$): Renowned Mediterranean restaurant in Singapore known for its authentic dishes inspired by Greece, Turkey, and Lebanon. They emphasize high-quality ingredients sourced from Greece, offering a warm and inviting dining experience. I love their EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) - it’s pretty much on every dish. Order their baked halloumi cheese too - it’s divine</li>
  <li>Bakalaki Greek Taverna ($$$): Less of a vibe compared to Blu Kouzina, but serves up incredible gyros and souvlakis</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/images/greek.jpg" alt="greek" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Feta salad with EVOO - an evergreen classic</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><u>Spanish<u></u></u></p>

<p>Similar to Mediterranean cuisine, Spanish food isn’t common in Singapore. The two below are absolute standouts for me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>FOC ($$$): One’s in sentosa whilst the other’s near boat quay. Master of the Josper grill. Try their Iberian pork jowl and the Josper grilled spanish octopus. Their desserts are not to be discounted.</li>
  <li>Olivia ($$$): Known for their blue cheese basque cheesecake and croquettes. Intimate and straight to the point Spanish food that transports you back to Barcelona</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Burgers<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are plenty of burger places in Singapore including popular chains. Shake shack has to be a shout out here because it is decent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Honbo ($$): Originally from Hong Kong and recently opened in Singapore. They serve up amazing smash patties with a fluffy potato milk bun, with their Double Gold American beef coming from Wisconsin</li>
  <li>Three buns ($$): As a part of the Potato Head Club, Three Buns is a popular burger joint known for its creative and delicious beef burgers. While it may not be the most budget-friendly option, the indulgent and delectable offerings make it a worthwhile culinary experience</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Steakhouse<u></u></u></p>

<p>Multiple restaurants serve steak in Singapore, but not a lot of them are steakhouses. I wouldn’t exactly call Burnt Ends a steakhouse given it does have a michelin star and is more relevated, but their steak is a definite highlight.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Burnt ends (\(\)): Famous for its wood-fired cooking techniques and innovative dishes. Their signature item, the Burnt Ends Sanger, is a must-try—a flavorful sandwich featuring smoked meats and homemade pickles, served on a potato roll. Order a steak even if it’s expensive. Don’t bother with their bakery</li>
  <li>Wolfgangs (\(\)): The best steakhouse I’ve been that’s not in South America. Incredibly pricey but their steaks are perfectly charred and grilled. Portions are extremely generous. A perfect pick for a marquee celebration</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Pizza<u></u></u></p>

<p>Singapore’s pizza scene is slowly growing, with a mix of American and Italian chains popping up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wild Child ($$): One of the best Neapolitan pizzas in Singapore. The dough is fluffy with a gorgeous amount of chewiness, complemented by quality ingredients. It’s known for its signature crack sauce that adds a burst of flavour to every pizza.</li>
  <li>Extra Virgin Pizza ($$): Less of a vibe than Wild Child, but there’s no doubt that their pizzas are divine. Their crusts are always beautifully charred and their innovative toppings amalgamate finely with the base</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="asian">Asian</h5>

<p><u>Taiwanese<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are quite a few Taiwanese-style restaurants, but not a lot of authentic Taiwanese food that is at the price point that it should be in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Isshin Machi ($$): My go-to Taiwanese restaurant in Singapore is Isshin Machi, with multiple locations across the island. I particularly adore their pork chop fried rice (which gives Din Tai Fung a run for its money) and their refreshing winter melon tea (not to sweet, just mellow)</li>
  <li>Abundance ($$): My old neighbourhood haunt that is massively underrated. Their gua baos, dumplings and bacon cabbage make for a perfect late night meal</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Cantonese / Dim sum<u></u></u></p>

<p>Hailing from Hong Kong, there is a long list of restaurants / dining establishments I default to. One I have to shout out is Canton Paradise. Those chain stores are decent. More on specific dim sum options in <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/dimsum/">my previous article</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legendary HK ($$): My default cha chaan teng. Huge variety of options, authentic cantonese flavours and very affordable. Their congee is divine and fluffy unlike Singaporean / Taiwanese congee</li>
  <li>So good ($$): So good has a couple of chains across the island, and whilst I prefer Legendary as my #1 cantonese haunt, So Good comes in as a close second. I’m a sucker for their breakfast and afternoon tea</li>
  <li>Wah lok: ($$) Best dim sum in SG. They don’t skimp on the ingredients, so expect plump siu mais and shrimp dumplings. Great value for money given the restaurant is situated at the Carlton hotel</li>
  <li>Fook kin ($$): Best cantonese roast that’s not fine dining or a preppy cantonese restaurant. Not 100% authentic cantonese cha siu (more of a malaysian style instead) but does a terrific job in delivering charred, tender roast meat</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Japanese<u></u></u></p>

<p>This is a weird one. There are plenty of fantastic japanese restaurants in Singapore at all price points. Unlike other cuisines, I can’t bring myself to eat high end Japanese food in Singapore as they are too criminally priced. Hence, the below are some of my more comfortable options.</p>

<p>The sushi bar: My go-to for chirashi bowls. The Sushi bar serves up generous portions at a very respectable price point. Feel free to ask them to swap out specific cuts of fish if you prefer others - I always ask for more Salmon instead of swordfish
Omote: Similar to the Sushi Bar, Omote serves up comfort japanese food. They have a branch in City Hall now so if I’m near there versus Orchard where The Sushi Bar is, I’ll pop in for a meal
Sushiro: ‘Fun’ conveyor belt sushi. Don’t hate on my recommendation but Sushiro is delightfully pleasant, with a frequent rotating menu to highlight seasonal cuts
Brothers ramen: A dining hall for many Japanese expats in Singapore. I love how clean their broth is and their ramen has the perfect amount of spring in it</p>

<p><u>Korean<u></u></u></p>

<p>There are plenty of korean food places along the Tanjong Pagar stretch, and they are all of impressive qualities. To highlight a few -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wang dae bak: Korean BBQ masterclass on top of a traditional grill. Book ahead of time as it always get filled</li>
  <li>SBCD tofu house: For hearty Sundubu jigae. Their tofu is made-in-house and is simple yet delicious</li>
  <li>Obba Jajang: MY go-to for jjajangmyeon and jjampong. Their banchan is average but I love their noodles (springy, chewy, slurpy)</li>
  <li>Magal: Versatile restaurant, with delicious BBQ options as well as jigaes (stew). Don’t skip out on their cockles rice and their gamjatang (pork bone stew)</li>
</ul>

<p>Singapore’s a culinary haven with lots of options. I hope my go-tos help you narrow down on food establishments that are of the best value. Let me know what your go-tos are - I’d love to shore up my list.</p>
