				<p>Arcteryx, for those who haven’t yet been indoctrinated, is that Canadian brand that’s become synonymous with outdoor adventure and overpriced jackets—because who wouldn’t want to look like they’re about to scale a mountain, even if they’re just strolling down Orchard Road?</p>

<p>In Singapore, it’s all the rage, with people swearing by their stylish yet functional gear, making you wonder if it’s more about their performance or the ability to wear a brand that screams “I’m an explorer” while sipping a flat white. From their iconic jackets to those ‘essential’ pants, there’s no denying the appeal, though the hefty price tag might have you questioning whether it’s worth the investment for your next nature hike or Instagram post. But don’t worry, I’ll break down why Arcteryx has earned its lofty reputation (and cost), and more importantly, where you can snag it for a price that won’t require you to sell a kidney. And for those not ready to commit to this outdoor fashion empire, stick around for some alternatives that might just let you look the part without the wallet shock.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-arcteryx">What is Arc’teryx?</h3>

<p>Arcteryx is a Canadian outdoor clothing and equipment company founded in 1989, known for its high-performance gear built to withstand extreme conditions. The brand’s name is inspired by Archaeopteryx, a prehistoric bird that symbolizes the evolution of flight, aligning with Arcteryx’s ethos of pushing boundaries in both design and function. The company initially made a name for itself by focusing on technical outerwear, creating products designed for climbers, skiers, and other extreme athletes who needed durable and reliable gear. Their commitment to quality and innovation quickly earned them a loyal following within outdoor sports communities, where the brand became synonymous with premium outdoor wear.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, Arcteryx expanded its reach globally, making a significant impact in fashion-conscious urban environments as well. In Singapore, the brand began to gain traction around the early 2010s, as a growing number of locals started to embrace not only outdoor activities but also the ‘activewear’ trend that blends fashion with function. With its sleek designs and the promise of high-performance technology, Arcteryx found its place in the hearts of both serious adventurers and those who just wanted to look like they were ready for a trek up Mount Everest, despite the sweltering Singaporean heat.</p>

  <li>Columbia Sportswear: A well-known brand offering affordable yet durable outdoor gear, including jackets, pants, and footwear for hiking, skiing, and other outdoor activities.</li>
  <li>Montbell: A Japanese brand offering lightweight and highly functional outdoor gear, Montbell is ideal for those looking for performance at a more affordable price.</li>
  <li>Helly Hansen: A Norwegian brand known for its waterproof jackets and gear, Helly Hansen provides high-quality outdoor clothing, especially for those braving wet and cold conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally think Helly Hansen is very underrated but let me know what you guys think about it! Arc’teryx is overpriced but whenever there’s a discount, that’s when I’ll consider.</p>
