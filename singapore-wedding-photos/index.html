				<p>In recent years, the institution of marriage has undergone significant changes in Singapore, reflecting shifting societal values, economic factors, and individual choices.</p>

<p>While marriage remains a vital aspect of Singaporean culture, it’s worth examining the trends and factors that have shaped the current landscape. Heads-up, marriage is not for everyone. Some even think it’s a scam. This isn’t an article about why you should or should not get married. By all means, do whatever that works for you. However, we will discuss how marriage has been shifting in Singapore, as well as what you should look out for when taking your wedding photos. In that regard, we are here to make sure you don’t get scammed by pesky wedding photographers.</p>

<h4 id="lets-begin-with-the-shifts-in-the-marriage-landscape">Let’s begin with the shifts in the marriage landscape</h4>

<p>There has been a changing attitude towards marriage in Singapore, Marriage has traditionally been viewed as a significant life milestone in Singapore, often symbolizing stability and commitment. However, contemporary attitudes towards marriage have evolved. Many young Singaporeans are choosing to delay marriage to focus on their careers, personal growth, and financial stability. The emphasis is now on marrying for love and compatibility rather than societal expectations. Some beginning thoughts on what else is driving the shift and other phenomena that have arose from this -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declining marriage rates: Singapore has witnessed a decline in marriage rates over the past decade. Factors such as increasing educational attainment, financial independence, and changing gender roles have contributed to this trend. People are prioritizing higher education and career advancement before considering marriage, resulting in later unions</li>
  <li>Cohabitation and unmarried parenthood: Cohabitation is becoming increasingly common in Singapore. Couples are choosing to live together and build their lives before formalizing their relationships through marriage. Additionally, the stigma surrounding unmarried parenthood has diminished, with more couples choosing to start families without traditional marriage</li>
  <li>Rising age at first marriage:The average age at which Singaporeans get married has risen steadily. Many are tying the knot in their late twenties or early thirties, compared to earlier generations who often married in their early twenties. This shift is driven by the pursuit of personal goals and financial stability before taking on the responsibilities of marriage</li>
  <li>Multicultural marriages: Singapore’s multicultural society has led to an increase in intercultural and cross-border marriages. Couples from different cultural backgrounds or nationalities are coming together, enriching the country’s cultural tapestry. These marriages often involve navigating unique challenges, such as cultural differences and immigration processes
Government initiatives: The Singaporean government has recognized the evolving dynamics of marriage and family life. Policies and initiatives, such as the Marriage and Parenthood Package, aim to support couples in building strong families. These initiatives include financial incentives, parental leave, and flexible work arrangements to encourage marriage and parenthood</li>
  <li>Embracing diversity: Singapore’s evolving attitudes towards marriage reflect a broader global trend of embracing diversity in relationships and family structures. While traditional marriages remain essential, the country’s openness to various relationship choices (although LGBT marriages are still not recognized) reflects a more inclusive and accepting society.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="should-i-have-a-wedding-or-should-i-just-rom">Should I have a wedding or should I just ROM?</h4>

<p>This is an increasingly common question amongst the younger generation. ROM stands for registration of marriage (aka signing  marriage papers). For those who have a wedding, most ROM during the wedding though some ROM prior the wedding itself. There are several reasons why an increasing number of people in Singapore are opting not to have traditional weddings and just opting for ROM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost: Weddings are expensive. Many couples find that the cost of hosting a wedding, which includes venue rental, catering, decor, and other expenses, can be a significant financial burden. As a result, some couples choose to allocate their resources differently, perhaps for a house, travel, or other financial goals</li>
  <li>Lifestyle choices: Some couples prefer to embrace a simpler and more minimalist lifestyle. They may opt for smaller, more intimate gatherings or choose alternative ways to celebrate their union that align with their values. Smaller, intimate gatherings with close family and friends are becoming increasingly popular. Couples often find that these smaller events are more meaningful and allow for deeper connections with their loved ones.</li>
  <li>Parents have less say: Parents have less influence nowadays when it comes to weddings. Weddings have traditionally been an occasion for parents to showcase and brag about their children. However, with a gradual decline in parental control over their offspring and more relaxed expectations regarding filial piety, parents find themselves with diminishing authority in orchestrating elaborate weddings</li>
  <li>Time Constraints: Planning a traditional wedding can be a time-consuming endeavor. In today’s fast-paced world, with demanding work schedules and various commitments, couples often find themselves strapped for time when it comes to organizing and carrying out a wedding. This situation often prompts them to opt for simpler alternatives. I’ve heard from numerous friends who, in hindsight, express a desire for a smaller-scale wedding or even forgo the idea of a wedding altogether. The stress associated with wedding planning, they recount, detracted from their ability to fully enjoy their own special day</li>
  <li>Cultural Shifts: Changing cultural norms and values can influence marriage choices. As societal attitudes evolve, there is less pressure to conform to traditional wedding expectations, allowing couples more flexibility in how they choose to celebrate their union</li>
  <li>COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted wedding plans for many couples. Restrictions on gatherings and health concerns have led some to postpone or downsize their weddings, while others have chosen to have small, intimate ceremonies. COVID officially showed the world that smaller weddings are ok!</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="whats-the-deal-with-destination-weddings">What’s the deal with destination weddings?</h4>

<p>Singaporeans often choose beautiful and picturesque destinations for their destination weddings. Here’s why you would do one:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scenic and unique locations: Destination weddings allow couples to tie the knot in picturesque and unique settings. From beachfront ceremonies to historic castles or tropical islands, the choice of location can be stunning and unforgettable</li>
  <li>Intimate gatherings: Many couples prefer smaller, more intimate weddings with only close family and friends. Destination weddings naturally limit the guest list, creating a more personal and meaningful experience. Don’t like an aunt or uncle? A destination wedding helps resolve this</li>
  <li>Built-In Honeymoon: Destination weddings often double as a honeymoon. Couples can seamlessly transition from the wedding festivities to their honeymoon, saving both time and money</li>
  <li>Neutral location: If the couple comes from different cultural backgrounds or has family in different locations, a destination wedding can be a way to bring everyone together and celebrate in a neutral location</li>
  <li>Reduced Stress: Destination wedding packages offered by resorts and venues often include wedding planning services. This can significantly reduce the stress associated with planning a traditional wedding</li>
  <li>Cost-Effective: In some cases, destination weddings can be more cost-effective than traditional weddings, especially when considering guest numbers and all-inclusive packages</li>
  <li>Symbolic Locations: Sometimes, couples choose a destination with personal significance, such as where they met or a place they’ve always dreamed of visiting</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some popular destination wedding locations favored by couples from Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bali, Indonesia: Bali is a top choice for destination weddings due to its stunning beaches, lush landscapes, and vibrant culture. Couples can exchange vows overlooking the Indian Ocean or in lush tropical gardens. Bali offers a range of wedding venues, from luxury resorts to private villas</li>
  <li>Phuket, Thailand: Phuket’s pristine beaches, crystal-clear waters, and luxurious resorts make it a sought-after destination for  weddings. Couples can have a beachfront ceremony or choose from numerous scenic venues. Thailand’s warm hospitality and exotic charm add to the appeal</li>
  <li>Santorini, Greece: Santorini’s iconic white-washed buildings, dramatic cliffs, and breathtaking sunsets create a romantic backdrop for weddings. Many couples opt for intimate ceremonies overlooking the caldera or in charming chapels</li>
  <li>Maldives: The Maldives offers a dreamy setting for beachfront weddings. Overwater bungalows, turquoise waters, and coral reefs make it a paradise for couples seeking a romantic escape and a unique wedding experience. Of course, it’s extremely expensive too</li>
  <li>Da Nang, Vietnam: A top choice given its proximity to Singapore alongside a good value for money. You’ll get amazing food and beaches similar to Bali, at a better cost</li>
</ul>

<p>These destination wedding locations offer a blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and romantic charm, making them popular choices for couples looking to create memorable and unique wedding experiences. Keep in mind that wedding planning for international destinations may involve additional logistical considerations, so it’s essential to plan ahead. I’ve been to weddings in Indonesia, Vietnam and Korea. They were all gorgeous in their own way.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-wedding-photos-so-expensive-in-singapore">Why are wedding photos so expensive in Singapore?</h4>

<p>Wedding photographs play an integral role in capturing the essence of the wedding experience. Different individuals opt for various approaches when it comes to photography. Some arrange pre-wedding photoshoots, while others focus on capturing moments on the wedding day itself. Some even choose to document their post-wedding moments. Moreover, there are options for both indoor and outdoor photoshoots, catering to individual preferences. Remarkably, the field of wedding photography has evolved into a thriving industry.</p>

<p>Wedding photography in Singapore can be relatively expensive for several reasons, and some couples opt to have their wedding photos taken abroad for cost savings and unique experiences. Let me tell you - this is the way to go. Here’s why wedding photography in Singapore can be costly and why couples consider overseas options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High Cost of Living: Singapore is known for its high cost of living, which affects various services, including wedding photography. Photographers have to cover their living expenses, equipment costs, and other overheads, leading to higher rates. This is the main reason</li>
  <li>Demand and Competition: Singapore’s wedding industry is highly competitive, with many couples vying for the best services. High demand often leads to photographers charging premium rates for their services. I would say not all photographers are quality, but given the limited supply in Singapore, rates are boosted up</li>
  <li>Customization and Packages: Photographers often offer customizable packages to meet the unique needs of each couple. These packages may include engagement sessions, pre-wedding shoots, and various album options, adding to the overall cost. Guess what? Singaporeans are needy. From the photographers I have spoken with, many said that Singaporean couples ask for more customizations versus couples of other backgrounds</li>

<p>Wedding photography selection can be distressing and financially damaging. The industry is filled with red flags and predatory sales tactics. Here are some wedding photo scams to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bait-and-Switch: A photographer showcases impressive work online, but when hired, provides subpar quality photos. They may even send a different photographer to the wedding</li>
  <li>Payment Upfront: Scammers may insist on full payment or a significant deposit before the wedding day, then disappear or provide substandard services. Legitimate photographers typically require a deposit, but be cautious if the request seems excessive</li>
  <li>No Contract: A reputable photographer will always provide a detailed contract outlining services, pricing, and terms. Avoid photographers who refuse to provide or sign a contract</li>
  <li>Hidden Fees and Payment Methods: The biggest one to watch out for. Some dishonest photographers may lure clients with seemingly low upfront prices but later add hidden fees for services like editing, album creation, buying ampoules or extra hours. Be sure to clarify all potential additional costs upfront and include them in the contract to avoid surprises</li>
  <li>Payment Methods: Scammers might encourage cash payments to avoid leaving a financial trail. This can be risky because it makes it difficult to track and dispute payments if there are issues with the service. Always choose secure payment methods like credit cards, checks, or online transfers, which provide records and some level of protection against fraud</li>
  <li>Individual Photo Sales: Be cautious if the photographer insists on selling individual photos separately after the event. This can result in significantly higher costs than initially quoted. Ideally, your contract should include all agreed-upon services and the delivery of a complete set of edited photos</li>
  <li>Pressure Sales Tactics: Be wary of photographers who use high-pressure sales tactics or make unrealistic promises to secure your business</li>
  <li>Limited-Time Offers: Promising exclusive discounts or offers that are only available if you make an immediate decision</li>
</ul>

<p>Artiz Studio serves as a quintessential example of a questionable business practice. The studio lacks price transparency, often springing additional photo costs on unsuspecting customers. Their sales tactics can be aggressive, employing hard-sell techniques, and sometimes resorting to demeaning competitors. They heavily promote a supposed “Korean vibe” while concealing hidden costs that can catch customers off guard. They initially presented a price but later informed us of limited-time packages that required an immediate decision on that same day. While the photography displayed in this studio appeared beautiful, their aggressive sales tactics discouraged us from considering further transactions with them. It is advisable to steer clear of this establishment. It’s worth noting that several other photography studios employ similar practices, so it’s essential to be prepared for their direct approach.</p>

<p>To avoid falling victim to wedding photo scams:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research photographers thoroughly, read reviews, and ask for references</li>
  <li>Meet with potential photographers in person or via video call to assess their professionalism</li>
  <li>Request a detailed contract that outlines all services, fees, and terms</li>
  <li>Pay using secure methods, such as credit cards, which offer some protection against fraud</li>
  <li>Trust your instincts. If something doesn’t feel right, consider other options. Cross-reference online in all review sites and social media platforms. People will speak up if they feel their experience was subpar</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s crucial to exercise caution and due diligence when hiring a wedding photographer to ensure that your special day is captured beautifully and without any unpleasant surprises.</p>
