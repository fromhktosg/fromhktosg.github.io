<h2 id="why-hotpot-and-steamboat-are-so-popular-in-singapore">Why Hotpot and Steamboat Are So Popular in Singapore</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hotpot (or steamboat) is more than just a meal — it’s a communal dining experience where friends and family gather around a bubbling pot to share food and conversation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Singapore’s multicultural food scene means there’s a hotpot style for everyone: from Chinese mala to Thai suki and Japanese shabu-shabu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The country’s tropical rainy weather encourages locals to enjoy warm, comforting hotpot sessions year-round.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hotpot is convenient and versatile, with options ranging from affordable 24/7 buffets to premium restaurants serving wagyu and fresh seafood.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether it’s a casual weekday dinner or a festive reunion meal, hotpot caters to every budget and occasion in Singapore.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-steamboat-and-hotpot">What’s the Difference Between Steamboat and Hotpot?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Terminology:</strong><br />
In Singapore and Malaysia, the terms “steamboat” and “hotpot” are often used interchangeably, but originally, they refer to similar styles of communal cooking where ingredients are cooked in simmering broth at the table.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Origins:</strong><br />
Hotpot is a traditional Chinese cooking method with many regional variations, while “steamboat” is a local term that became popular in Southeast Asia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Broth Variety:</strong><br />
Both use a variety of broths, but hotpot often highlights distinct regional flavors like Sichuan mala or Cantonese herbal, whereas steamboat may focus on simpler, clearer soups or fusion styles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dining Style:</strong><br />
Both are interactive dining experiences, but steamboat in Singapore sometimes emphasizes buffet-style setups or casual dining, while hotpot can also include premium, à la carte options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />
The types of ingredients used are largely the same — thinly sliced meats, seafood, vegetables, tofu, and noodles — but presentation and dipping sauces might differ depending on the restaurant.</p>
