				<p>In this post, I’ll dive into all things Sentosa—its fascinating history as a former military base, 
what makes it a standout destination, and the attractions that draw millions each year. I’ll also 
touch on potential drawbacks, future developments, and share tips on the best activities and 
dining spots. Whether you’re planning a visit or just curious, this guide will cover it all!</p>

<p><strong>Where is Sentosa</strong></p>

<p>Sentosa is located just off the southern coast of Singapore, connected to the mainland by a 
causeway, cable car, and monorail. It’s situated near HarbourFront, accessible via Sentosa Gateway 
or VivoCity, making it a convenient destination for both locals and tourists. This island resort 
spans 500 hectares and is a hub for leisure, entertainment, and relaxation.</p>

<p><strong>History of Sentosa</strong></p>

<p>Sentosa’s story is as fascinating as the island itself—a tale of transformation from a sleepy 
outpost to Singapore’s favorite playground. Back in the day, it was called Pulau Blakang Mati, 
which roughly translates to “Island of Death from Behind.” The eerie name likely stemmed from its 
history of pirate attacks or malaria outbreaks, but the island’s strategic location made it far 
too valuable to ignore. The British turned it into a military stronghold, building Fort Siloso to 
defend Singapore’s vital shipping lanes. During World War II, this fort played a key role in 
Singapore’s defense, though it couldn’t prevent the island from falling to the Japanese.</p>

<p>After the war, Sentosa remained a military base for a while, but Singapore had bigger plans for 
the island. In 1972, it was renamed “Sentosa,” meaning “peace and tranquility” in Malay—a total 
rebranding to shake off its grim past and signal a bright future. What followed was an ambitious 
transformation: beaches were built, a cable car was launched, and iconic landmarks like the 
Merlion statue started to shape the island’s identity as a tourist destination.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the late 2000s, Sentosa leveled up big time. Resorts World Sentosa brought in 
Universal Studios Singapore, world-class hotels, a casino, and the jaw-dropping S.E.A. Aquarium, 
turning the island into a global hotspot. And while its modern attractions get all the hype, 
places like Fort Siloso remind visitors of the island’s rich history.</p>

<p>Sentosa today is a symbol of Singapore’s incredible ability to evolve and innovate. From its 
colonial roots to its vibrant present, the island’s journey is nothing short of inspiring—a story 
that makes every visit feel like stepping into a piece of living history.</p>

<p><strong>What to do in Sentosa</strong></p>

guide to some of the best things to do on the island:</p>
