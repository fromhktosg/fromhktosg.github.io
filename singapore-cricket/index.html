				<p>Cricket in Singapore might not be as popular as football, but it’s still quite the sport for a dedicated group, especially when you’re talking about the Singapore Cricket Association and the Singapore cricket team</p>

<p>So, why do people like cricket? Maybe it’s the excitement of the SPL fixtures or just a great way to escape the heat while playing at places like the Kallang Cricket Ground or West Coast Park. As for which nationalities are most into cricket in Singapore—well, you’d be surprised that the Indian community leads the charge, with a few other cricket-loving nations not too far behind. If you’re wondering whether there are cricket leagues or even classes in Singapore, the answer is yes, of course—just check out local forums for leagues like the Singapore Cricket League (SCL) or cricket academies like the Cricket Coaching Academy. And if you want to take it global, well, cricket leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) or the Big Bash League are just a few of the big names to know.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-cricket">What is cricket?</h3>

<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport, often considered the second most popular game in the world (behind football, of course). Played between two teams of 11 players each, the objective is for one team to score as many runs as possible while the other team tries to dismiss them—sounds simple, right? The game is typically played on an oval-shaped field with a pitch in the center, where the action happens. Players use a bat to hit a ball, while bowlers (yes, they’re not called pitchers here) try to get them out in various entertaining ways. Whether you’re watching the SPL or the IPL, cricket is all about strategy, teamwork, and, for some reason, a lot of tea breaks. Cricket originated in England in the 16th century, evolving from a simple rural game into the globally followed sport we know today.</p>
