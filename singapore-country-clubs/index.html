				<p>I played tennis at the <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-best-hotels/">Capella</a> a couple weeks back. Whilst it isn’t a country club, the establishment in its grandeur and luxury sure felt like one.</p>

<p>Having personally experienced the allure of country clubs while being part of one in Hong Kong, I was naturally drawn to explore what Singapore’s country clubs have to offer. Today, we’ll unpack a little about country clubs, including the verdant landscapes and luxurious amenities and weighing the question on everyone’s mind: Are they worth it? Join me as we unravel the world of Singaporean country clubs and discover whether these exclusive enclaves truly live up to their reputation.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-5-cs-that-all-singaporeans-revere">What are the 5 C’s that all Singaporeans revere?</h4>

<p>In the realm of Singaporean culture and lifestyle, the “5 Cs” have long held a special place. Historically symbolizing cash, car, credit card, condominium and country club, these markers of affluence have shaped aspirations and defined success for generations of Singaporeans. These five Cs are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cash: Refers to the pursuit of wealth and financial success</li>
  <li>Car: Singapore’s car prices are among the highest in the world due to significant taxes and fees, making car ownership a status symbol</li>
  <li>Credit Card: Self-explanatory, although getting a credit card was much more difficult a generation back</li>
  <li>Condo: Owned private real estate versus government housing (HDBs) is much more valuable (and comfortable)</li>
  <li>Country Club: Joining an exclusive country club is considered a symbol of prestige</li>
</ul>

<p>While the concept of the five C’s is often taken lightly, many Singaporeans adhere to its philosophy and aspire to ‘collect them all.’</p>

<h4 id="how-did-country-clubs-come-about-in-singapore">How did country clubs come about in Singapore?</h4>

<p>The roots of country clubs can be traced back to a time when colonial influences and British traditions shaped Singapore’s landscape. These clubs emerged as enclaves where colonial expatriates gathered to escape the tropical heat, indulge in recreational activities, and foster a sense of community. Over the decades, these exclusive retreats have evolved to become more diverse, catering to the changing demographics and interests of Singapore’s populace. However, this is also the reason why many country clubs are named after particular countries i.e. The American Club.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-you-join-a-country-club">Why should you join a country club?</h4>

<p>During my membership at a country club in Hong Kong, I dedicated the majority of my time to utilizing their tennis facilities, spending six days a week there for training. In fact, the country club became my third most frequently visited location, following my school and home. A good amount of my friends hung out there too. Looking back, I loved being part of that community. Here’s why there’s merit in joining a country club -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sanctuary lifestyle: At their core, country clubs in Singapore serve as sanctuaries, offering members an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban living. They are nestled amidst lush greenery, providing an oasis of tranquility where one can reconnect with nature, unwind, and recharge. It’s a place where time seems to slow down, and the stresses of daily life fade into the background</li>
  <li>Facilities: One of the defining features of country clubs is their extensive range of recreational facilities. While golf courses remain a hallmark, these clubs have diversified to include tennis courts, swimming pools, gyms, and even equestrian facilities. This diversity ensures that members of all ages can find activities that cater to their interests and fitness levels</li>
  <li>Fine dining: From casual poolside snacks to elegant fine dining experiences, these clubs boast a variety of dining options. Members can savor an array of cuisines and delight in gastronomic adventures, often accompanied by scenic views of the club’s sprawling grounds</li>
  <li>Networking: Beyond leisure and sports, country clubs play a pivotal role as social hubs. They provide a platform for networking and building relationships among individuals from diverse backgrounds. Memberships often span generations, creating a sense of community and continuity that extends beyond the club’s facilities</li>
  <li>Family activities: Many country clubs recognize the importance of family bonding. They offer family-friendly amenities, including children’s play areas, kid-focused activities, and even educational programs. These clubs become places where generations come together to create lasting memories</li>
  <li>Exclusive Events and Entertainment: Country clubs often host exclusive events, including gala dinners, themed parties, and cultural celebrations. These gatherings provide members with opportunities to socialize and enjoy unique entertainment experiences</li>
  <li>Prestige and Status: Joining a prestigious country club can enhance one’s social status and reputation, as these clubs are often associated with affluence and success</li>
  <li>Legacy and Tradition: Some members value the sense of tradition and heritage associated with country clubs. Membership often spans generations, creating a sense of continuity and belonging</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-are-memberships-like">What are memberships like?</h4>

<p>On to the elephant in the room - how do memberships work?</p>

<p>Country clubs in Singapore typically offer various types of memberships to cater to the diverse preferences and needs of individuals and families. These memberships often include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ordinary or Full Membership: This is the most comprehensive and prestigious membership category, providing access to all club facilities and amenities, including golf courses, sports facilities, dining, and social events. Full members often have voting rights and may be required to pay an initiation fee and monthly dues. Some memberships are transferable - obviously, a transferable one is more expensive</li>
  <li>Associate Membership: Associate members enjoy most of the privileges of full membership but may have restrictions, such as limited access to certain facilities or no voting rights. Associate memberships are often available to family members of full members or individuals who do not meet the criteria for full membership.</li>
  <li>Social or Non-Golfing Membership: Social members typically have access to the club’s dining, social events, and some recreational facilities but do not have golfing privileges. This membership category is suitable for individuals or families who are primarily interested in the club’s social aspects.</li>
  <li>Corporate Membership: Corporate memberships are often offered to businesses and organizations. They provide access to club facilities for employees and clients. Corporate members may also use the club for business events and meetings.</li>
  <li>Term Membership: Term memberships are typically offered for a specific duration, such as one or two years. They are suitable for individuals who may want to experience the club for a limited time without a long-term commitment.</li>
  <li>Family Membership: Family memberships extend privileges to the member, their spouse, and dependent children. It provides a family-friendly environment with access to family-oriented amenities</li>
  <li>Sport membership: Primary access to sports facilities; often without voting rights</li>
</ul>

<p>To grossly summarize how much a country club membership costs -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entry-level country clubs might have initiation fees ranging from SGD 5,000 to SGD 10,000, with annual subscription fees of around SGD 1,000 to SGD 3,000</li>
  <li>Mid-tier country clubs may require initiation fees of SGD 15,000 to SGD 30,000 or more, with annual subscription fees ranging from SGD 2,000 to SGD 5,000 or higher</li>

<p>It depends. Ultimately, it’s often more about status, but if you spend a significant amount of time there and a country club offers a place for your children to socialize, it can be justifiable.</p>

<h4 id="what-alternatives-to-country-clubs-are-there">What alternatives to country clubs are there?</h4>

<p>Aka where do those more money conscious or less wealthy go to.</p>

<p><u>Hometeam NS<u>

Hometeam NS offers affordable memberships that grant access to these facilities, making it a popular choice for those seeking an inclusive and community-oriented environment</u></u></p>

<p><u>Condo Clubhouses:<u>
Private Condo Facilities: Many condominiums in Singapore offer exclusive clubhouses and amenities within their complexes. These condo clubhouses are typically reserved for residents and their guests, providing a convenient and private space for leisure and social gatherings. Depending on the condominium, you may find features like swimming pools for residents to relax and cool off, fully equipped fitness centers for workouts, BBQ pits for outdoor gatherings, and function rooms suitable for events and celebrations. Residents can enjoy these facilities within the comfort of their condo community, fostering a sense of belonging and convenience</u></u></p>

<p><u>Shopping Malls:<u>
Singapore boasts a plethora of world-class [shopping malls](https://fromhktosg.github.io/shopping-in-singapore) that offer more than just shopping opportunities. These malls are vibrant hubs where people gather to indulge in various forms of entertainment, dining, and recreation. Inside these malls, you can find entertainment zones with arcade games, cinemas screening the latest films, food courts serving diverse cuisines, and indoor playgrounds designed for children's enjoyment. Popular malls like Orchard Central, VivoCity, and Jewel Changi Airport provide a wide range of recreational activities, ensuring that visitors can have a full day of fun and relaxation.</u></u></p>

<p><u>Community Centers (CCs) and Community Clubs<u>
Singapore's network of Community Centers (CCs) and Residents' Committees (RCs) plays a vital role in fostering community engagement and organizing a diverse array of activities. These centers serve as focal points for residents to participate in social, cultural, and recreational events. CCs and RCs offer programs such as fitness classes, art workshops, sports events, and cultural performances. Some of these centers also feature sports facilities like tennis courts and basketball courts, providing opportunities for physical activities and bonding with neighbors. Membership options are often available, allowing residents to access these facilities and programs at reasonable rates, enhancing community spirit and cohesion.</u></u></p>

<p>Honestly, the options above sound pretty sound lame compared to a country club, but there’s nothing wrong with being more frugal and responsible. Ultimately, a country club provides its own merits and it’s understandable that Singaporeans want to strive to be part of one. I know I will.
