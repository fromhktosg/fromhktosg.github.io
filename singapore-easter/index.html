				<p>Easter in Singapore – the time when Easter events Singapore are in full swing, Easter egg hunts Singapore are everywhere, and the hunt for the perfect Easter brunch Singapore becomes a priority.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering when Easter is or why people celebrate it, let’s just say it involves a mix of history, religion, and, of course, indulgence in Easter promotions Singapore.

Looking ahead, Easter 2025 Singapore is already on the horizon, so get ready for another round of all the festivities.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-easter">What is Easter?</h3>

<p>Easter is a Christian holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is said to have occurred three days after his crucifixion. It’s the culmination of the Passion of Jesus, marking the end of the Lent season and the beginning of a new life, both spiritually and symbolically. While the religious significance centers around themes of rebirth and redemption, Easter has also become a cultural celebration filled with traditions like egg hunting, feasting, and spending time with family. In Singapore, you’ll find various Easter events, including church services and festive gatherings, but also plenty of “Easter promotions” and “Easter brunches” for those just in it for the long weekend.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-easter-2025">When is Easter 2025?</h3>

<p>Easter doesn’t have a fixed date; it falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox, which means it can be anywhere between March 22 and April 25. In 2025, Easter will be celebrated on April 20. So, if you’re planning for “Easter events Singapore” or hoping to snag some last-minute Easter shopping Singapore deals, now’s the time to mark your calendar! And don’t forget to plan ahead for Easter brunch Singapore and Easter egg hunt Singapore fun.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-people-celebrate-easter">Why do people celebrate Easter?</h3>

<p>People celebrate Easter to honor the resurrection of Jesus Christ, marking his victory over death and the promise of eternal life for believers. For Christians, it’s the most significant event in their faith, symbolizing renewal, hope, and salvation. Outside of the religious aspect, Easter has evolved into a cultural celebration, with traditions. The holiday is also a great excuse for Easter shopping Singapore – because nothing says celebration like filling up a basket with chocolate eggs and festive decorations. It’s a time for reflection, festivities, and, of course, catching up on all those Easter promotions Singapore.</p>
