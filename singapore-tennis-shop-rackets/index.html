				<p>Tennis in Singapore might not exactly be as popular as, say, the pursuit of air conditioning, but it’s definitely got its fans, especially when you’re looking to hit a few balls in style. Whether you’re trying to figure out where to play or what gear you’ll need to take on that intense rally, we’ve got you covered—spoiler alert: you can’t just rock up with a racquet you found in your closet. From choosing the perfect racket at places like Queensway Shopping Centre or TennisHub, to making sure you have the right strings and tennis shoes, this guide will help you avoid looking like a newbie, all while knowing exactly where to buy the best gear in Singapore.</p>

<h3 id="is-tennis-popular-in-singapore">Is tennis popular in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Tennis in Singapore isn’t exactly the nation’s favorite pastime, but it does have a dedicated following. In 2023, there were approximately 205,700 tennis court bookings, a slight decrease from the previous year. The island boasts around 189 tennis courts, offering ample opportunities for enthusiasts to play. Additionally, the Singapore Tennis Association maintains a national ranking system, highlighting the competitive spirit among local players.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-you-play-tennis-in-singapore">Where can you play tennis in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Here’s a list of different types of venues where you can play tennis in Singapore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Public Tennis Centres (e.g., Kallang Tennis Centre, Queenstown Tennis Centre) – Managed by Sport Singapore, these are budget-friendly options with a variety of courts.</li>
  <li>Private Condominiums – Many upscale condos in Singapore feature their own tennis courts, offering convenient access for residents.</li>
  <li>Country Clubs (e.g., Singapore Island Country Club, Tanah Merah Country Club) – For those looking for a more exclusive experience, country clubs provide top-notch facilities and services.</li>
  <li>Sports Complexes (e.g., Singapore Sports Hub) – These large, <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/sports-singapore/">multi-sport venues</a> often have a range of tennis courts available for booking.</li>
  <li>Resorts and Hotels (e.g., Sentosa Resorts, The Fullerton Bay Hotel) – High-end resorts and hotels also feature tennis courts, typically available to guests or members.</li>
  <li>ActiveSG Tennis Centres – These government-managed venues are spread throughout Singapore, offering affordable tennis facilities for everyone.</li>
  <li>Private Clubs (e.g., The Tanglin Club, The British Club) – These membership-based clubs offer private and well-maintained courts for tennis lovers.</li>
  <li>Recreational Parks (e.g., East Coast Park) – Some parks provide tennis courts, allowing casual play amidst scenic surroundings.</li>
</ul>

<p>These venues vary in terms of accessibility, cost, and exclusivity, giving you a range of options depending on your needs.</p>

<h3 id="what-gear-do-you-need-to-play-tennis">What gear do you need to play tennis?</h3>

<p>Here’s the basic gear you’ll need to play tennis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tennis Racket – The most essential item. Rackets come in various sizes, weights, and materials, so choosing one that suits your skill level and playing style is key. Cost: $100–$400+ depending on brand and materials.</li>
  <li>Tennis Balls – Standard tennis balls are made of rubber and covered with felt. There are different types for different surfaces (hard court, clay, grass). Cost: $5–$15 per can (3–4 balls).</li>
  <li>Tennis Shoes – Specialized shoes with good grip and support to handle the quick movements and lateral motions typical in tennis. Cost: $80–$200.</li>
  <li>Sportswear – Comfortable, moisture-wicking clothing that allows free movement. Many players wear tennis-specific attire, including skirts or shorts and performance shirts. Cost: $30–$100 per item.</li>
  <li>Grip Tape – To ensure a good hold on your racket, grip tape helps improve comfort and prevent slippage. Cost: $5–$20 per roll or pack.</li>
  <li>Water Bottle – Hydration is important, especially in Singapore’s tropical climate, so always have a bottle on hand. Cost: $10–$50 for reusable bottles.</li>
  <li>Tennis Bag – A bag designed to carry your racket(s), balls, shoes, and extra gear. Some even have compartments to keep your wet clothes separate. Cost: $40–$150.</li>
  <li>Sunscreen and Hat – Essential for outdoor players, especially in the Singapore sun. Protecting your skin is a must. Cost: $10–$30 for sunscreen, $15–$50 for a hat.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should cover the basics, and depending on your level or preferences, you can always add more specialized gear like wristbands or knee supports!</p>

<p>More on each of these specifics in a later post</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-decide-what-tennis-racket-to-get">How do you decide what tennis racket to get?</h3>

<p>Choosing the right tennis racket can make a huge difference in your game. Here’s how to decide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skill Level – Beginners typically prefer rackets that offer more power and forgiveness, with a larger head size (oversized rackets) and lighter weight. Advanced players may choose a smaller head size and heavier racket for more control and precision.</li>
  <li>Head Size – The size of the racket’s head affects power and control. Larger heads (100-110 square inches) provide more power, while smaller heads (85-95 square inches) offer more control.</li>
  <li>Weight – Lighter rackets (under 300g) are easier to maneuver, making them ideal for beginners or players who rely on quick reactions. Heavier rackets (above 300g) provide more stability and control, suited for advanced players.</li>
  <li>Grip Size – Your grip size should feel comfortable when holding the racket. If it’s too big or small, it can lead to discomfort or injury. Use a measuring guide or consult experts at a sports store to find the right fit.</li>
  <li>Balance – Rackets are either head-heavy, head-light, or evenly balanced. Head-heavy rackets give more power, while head-light rackets offer better control and maneuverability. An even balance provides a good mix of both.</li>
  <li>String Pattern – Open string patterns (e.g., 16x19) offer more spin and power, while denser string patterns (e.g., 18x20) provide more control and durability.</li>
  <li>Material – Most rackets are made from graphite, carbon fiber, or a mix of both. Graphite provides a good balance of power and control, while carbon fiber is typically more lightweight and flexible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to demo a few rackets at a tennis shop or sporting store to see which feels the most comfortable and best matches your playing style. And remember, no racket can fix poor technique—it’s all about finding the right fit to complement your game!</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-select-tennis-strings">How do you select tennis strings?</h3>

<p>Selecting the right tennis strings is just as important as choosing the right racket. Here’s how to decide:</p>

<ol>
  <li>String Material – Different materials affect your play style:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Natural Gut: Offers excellent comfort, power, and feel but comes at a higher price. Ideal for players with arm issues or who seek a soft, responsive feel.</li>
  <li>Polyester (Poly): Known for durability and control, poly strings are great for advanced players who generate their own power and need more spin. However, they can be harsh on the arm.</li>
  <li>Nylon: A more affordable option that provides a balance of comfort, durability, and power, often used by recreational players.</li>
  <li>Hybrid: Combines two types of strings (e.g., natural gut in the mains and polyester in the crosses) to balance power, control, and durability.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>String Gauge (Thickness) – The thickness of the string affects durability and playability:</li>
</ol>

<p>Thicker strings (16 or 15 gauge) are more durable but offer less spin and feel.
Thinner strings (17 or 18 gauge) provide more spin and feel but are less durable and may break faster.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tension – The tension at which your strings are strung can affect power and control:</li>
</ol>

<p>Higher tension provides more control but less power (better for advanced players).
Lower tension gives more power but less control (better for beginners or those seeking a softer feel).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Spin Potential – If you want more spin, consider strings with a more textured surface or a looser string pattern. Polyester strings often provide good spin potential due to their stiffness and grip on the ball.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Comfort and Arm Health – If you’re prone to tennis elbow or other arm injuries, look for strings that offer a soft feel, like natural gut or multifilament strings. Polyester strings tend to be stiffer and may aggravate arm issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Durability – If you’re a frequent player, you may need durable strings like polyester, which withstand more wear and tear. For casual players, nylon or natural gut can be a good choice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, it’s a balancing act between power, control, durability, and comfort. You might want to experiment with different setups to find what best suits your playing style and needs.</p>
