				<p>We know Singaporeans love going to Japan for <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-flights/">vacation</a>. If you’ve ever dreamed of soaking in a hot spring or onsen while pretending you’re in a serene Japanese ryokan, you’re not alone.</p>

<p>Onsens, Japan’s natural hot springs, aren’t just for relaxation; they’re practically a cultural experience, offering everything from therapeutic benefits to a great excuse to let your mind wander while you sit in glorified boiling water. Whether you’re opting for the traditional full experience in a ryokan or just day-tripping to a local onsen, there’s something about those steamy waters that make you feel like you’re doing something good for your body—even if all you’re really doing is sitting there. From health benefits like improved circulation to the variety of onsens—from public baths to luxurious resort-style ones—there’s something to suit every mood, day or night. So, are there any onsens in Singapore that can compare to Japan’s? Well, let’s just say we might not have Mount Fuji nearby, but there’s always a chance to dip your toes into a little hot water.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-onsens">What are onsens?</h3>

<p>Onsens are natural hot springs found in Japan, created by geothermal activity that heats the water, making it perfect for bathing. These springs are rich in minerals like sulfur, sodium, and calcium, which are believed to have therapeutic effects on the body, helping with ailments like joint pain, skin conditions, and stress. People flock to onsens not just for the healing properties of the water but for the whole experience—taking time to relax, unwind, and connect with nature in a serene environment. Onsens can be found in both public baths and private settings, often nestled in scenic areas like mountains or forests, providing a peaceful escape. Whether you’re soaking in a rustic outdoor bath or indulging in a luxurious resort-style onsen, the practice is deeply woven into Japanese culture.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-ryokans">What are ryokans?</h3>

<p>Ryokans are traditional Japanese inns that offer a unique and immersive cultural experience. Staying in a ryokan is like stepping back in time, where you get to enjoy tatami mat floors, sliding paper doors, and futon beds laid out for you at night. The real draw, though, is the hospitality—often, ryokans include kaiseki meals (a multi-course feast) and access to private onsens, making it an all-in-one retreat. These inns are located in scenic areas, sometimes close to onsens, giving you the perfect mix of relaxation and tradition. It’s the ultimate way to experience Japan’s famous blend of simplicity and elegance, with a touch of “you’ll never want to leave” comfort.</p>

<h3 id="history-of-ryokans-and-onsens">History of ryokans and onsens</h3>

<p>Ryokans and onsens have deep roots in Japanese history, both playing crucial roles in the country’s cultural and social fabric. Ryokans date back to the 8th century during the Nara period, originally serving as resting spots for travelers along Japan’s ancient roads. Over time, these inns evolved into luxurious retreats, offering not only a place to stay but a way to experience traditional Japanese customs, food, and hospitality. On the other hand, onsens have been used for thousands of years, with their therapeutic properties first recognized as early as the 8th century as well. They became especially popular during the Edo period (1603-1868) when people began to frequent them for both health reasons and relaxation. Together, ryokans and onsens have become symbols of Japanese culture, offering both locals and tourists a way to unwind, enjoy nature, and connect with centuries-old traditions.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-people-like-going-to-onsens">Why do people like going to onsens?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Relaxation – The warm, mineral-rich waters soothe sore muscles and ease tension, offering a calming escape from daily stress. Onsen water temperatures typically range from 38°C to 42°C (100°F to 108°F), providing the perfect balance between comfort and therapeutic warmth.</li>
  <li>Health Benefits – Onsen waters are rich in minerals like sulfur, sodium chloride, and calcium, which are believed to help with a variety of health conditions. Regular soaking can improve blood circulation, alleviate muscle and joint pain, and promote detoxification. Sulfur-rich baths, for instance, are known for their skin-healing properties and can help treat conditions like eczema and psoriasis.</li>
  <li>Nature Immersion – Many onsens are located in scenic areas, allowing bathers to enjoy natural beauty while unwinding. The calming environment is scientifically shown to lower stress hormone levels and promote a sense of overall well-being.</li>
  <li>Cultural Experience – The rituals involved in bathing at an onsen, such as thoroughly cleaning before soaking, offer a unique chance to immerse in Japanese tradition. The process itself encourages mindfulness, which has been linked to reduced anxiety and improved mental health.</li>
  <li>Self-Care – It’s a guilt-free excuse to relax and do nothing, all while feeling like you’re indulging in wellness and rejuvenation. Studies have shown that thermal baths can improve sleep quality and even boost immune function, making an onsen visit feel even more rewarding.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="risks-of-going-to-onsens--when-should-you-not-go-to-an-onsen">Risks of going to onsens / when should you not go to an onsen</h3>

<p>While onsens offer a lot of benefits, there are some risks and situations where it’s best to avoid them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High-Temperature Sensitivity – If you’re sensitive to heat or have a condition like high blood pressure or heart problems, the hot water can be overwhelming and cause dizziness or fainting. It’s important to listen to your body and avoid prolonged soaking in very hot water.</li>
  <li>Pregnancy – Pregnant women should avoid onsens, especially those with very hot water, as the heat can raise body temperature and potentially harm the fetus. Some onsens have specific pools for expectant mothers, but it’s safest to consult a doctor before going.</li>
  <li>Open Wounds or Skin Infections – If you have open cuts, wounds, or active skin infections like rashes or boils, it’s best to stay out of the onsen. The hot water can irritate wounds and potentially introduce bacteria.</li>
  <li>Alcohol Consumption – Going into an onsen after drinking alcohol can increase the risk of dehydration, overheating, or fainting due to the combination of alcohol and the hot water. It’s better to enjoy your soak when sober.</li>
  <li>Medical Conditions – If you have conditions like diabetes, respiratory issues, or circulatory problems, consult a doctor before entering an onsen, as hot water can exacerbate certain health concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a general rule, always remember to stay hydrated, limit your soaking time, and be mindful of how your body reacts to the heat. If you’re feeling unwell, it’s best to skip the onsen altogether.</p>

<h3 id="etiquettes-of-going-to-an-onsen">Etiquettes of going to an onsen</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Shower First – Always wash and thoroughly rinse your body before entering the onsen. There is generally a designated area with shower stations for this purpose, equipped with stools, handheld showerheads, and soap. This is not only for hygiene but also a sign of respect for other bathers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep Your Hair Out of the Water – If you have long hair, tie it up to avoid it touching the water. Wet hair can transfer dirt and oils into the bath.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid Loud Noise – Keep conversations quiet and respectful. Onsens are meant to be peaceful, relaxing spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Diving or Splashing – Don’t splash water or engage in any vigorous movement. Relaxing is key, not swimming or playing around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t Soak for Too Long – Limit your soak to around 15-20 minutes at a time. Too long can cause overheating and dehydration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Towels Stay Outside – Bring a small towel for washing, but leave it outside the onsen when you soak. It’s considered impolite to bring it into the water.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No Photography – Keep your phone and camera away to maintain the peaceful, private nature of the onsen and respect the privacy of others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be Respectful of Others’ Space – Onsens can be communal, so be mindful of personal space and avoid crowding other bathers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid Using Soap in the Bath – Soap should only be used during your pre-bath shower, not in the onsen itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rinse After Soaking – After enjoying the onsen, rinse off any residual minerals from your body. This helps cleanse your skin and closes your pores.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-do-they-give-you-a-little-face-towel-in-the-onsen">Why do they give you a little face towel in the onsen?</h3>

<p>The little towel given at the onsen serves several practical and cultural purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use to Wash Your Body in the Shower – You can use the towel to scrub and rinse your body during the pre-bath shower, helping with personal hygiene before entering the onsen. There is generally a designated area with shower stations for this purpose, equipped with stools, handheld showerheads, and soap. This ensures you’re thoroughly clean before soaking in the communal bath.</li>
  <li>Use to Wipe Sweat When in the Hot Bath – While soaking in the onsen, you can place the towel on your head or use it to wipe off sweat. This helps keep you comfortable while relaxing in the hot water.</li>
  <li>Use to Hide Your Body When Walking From One Bath to Another – The towel provides modesty as you move between bath areas. While you don’t bring it into the water, it’s a simple way to cover up while walking between different sections of the onsen.</li>
  <li>Use to Dry Off Before Stepping Back into the Changing Area – After your soak, the towel can be used to gently pat yourself dry before returning to the changing area, ensuring you don’t drip water onto the floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The towel is a small but essential part of the onsen experience, helping maintain hygiene, respect for others, and adding to the overall cultural tradition.</p>

<h3 id="what-type-of-onsens-are-there">What type of onsens are there?</h3>

<p>There are several types of onsens, each offering a unique experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indoor Onsens (内湯, Uchiyu) – These are located inside buildings and are typically more private. They’re great for colder weather or those who prefer a more controlled environment. Indoor onsens often have beautifully tiled baths and a serene atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Outdoor Onsens (露天風呂, Rotenburo) – These are the iconic onsens that offer natural settings, with views of mountains, forests, or rivers. Soaking in an outdoor onsen, especially in cooler weather, provides a soothing contrast to the heat of the water.</li>
  <li>Private Onsens (貸切風呂, Kashikiri-buro) – These are smaller, more intimate baths that can be reserved for individuals or couples. They provide the experience of an onsen without the crowd, making them perfect for those who prefer privacy.</li>
  <li>Public Onsens (大浴場, Daiyokujou) – These are communal baths, often in large, open spaces where you can enjoy the onsen with other bathers. Public onsens are the most traditional and common in Japan.</li>
  <li>Day Onsens (日帰り温泉, Higaeri Onsen) – These are onsens that you can visit during the day, often included as part of a larger resort or hotel experience. They’re perfect for a relaxing afternoon soak and are sometimes combined with lunch or other wellness activities.</li>
  <li>Night Onsens (夜の温泉, Yoru no Onsen) – Some onsens are particularly magical at night, with tranquil, dimly-lit environments that enhance the sense of peace. Nighttime onsens offer a calm, almost mystical experience, where you can soak under the stars or in a quiet, candlelit room.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-are-the-onsens-in-japan">Where are the onsens in Japan?</h3>

<p>Onsens can be found all over Japan, from the snowy mountains of Hokkaido to the tropical islands of Okinawa.

<h3 id="are-there-any-onsens-in-singapore">Are there any onsens in Singapore?</h3>

<p>There are a few onsen experiences in Singapore, though they are not quite as abundant as in Japan. While Singapore doesn’t have natural hot spring resorts like those in Japan, it does have on-the-rise spa centers and wellness facilities that offer similar experiences to what you would find in an onsen. Here are a few places to check out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Yunomori Onsen &amp; Spa</li>
</ol>

<p>Location: Kallang Wave Mall
This is probably the most authentic onsen experience in Singapore. Yunomori features Japanese-style hot spring baths, including indoor and outdoor baths, a dry sauna, and a mud bath. While the waters aren’t natural hot springs, they provide a very similar relaxation experience.
Special Feature: Their wellness packages include spa treatments, massage, and relaxation therapies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Samsara Wellness</li>
</ol>

<p>Location: Queen Street
Samsara Wellness offers a unique blend of traditional Japanese onsen and modern wellness services. You can enjoy private onsen experiences along with body treatments that replicate the onsen experience.
Special Feature: They focus on combining natural treatments and relaxation with a Japanese-inspired aesthetic.</p>

<ol>

Special Feature: It focuses on combining high-tech wellness treatments with Japanese-inspired traditions.</p>

<h3 id="why-arent-there-more-onsens-in-singapore">Why Aren’t There More Onsens in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Singapore’s geological structure doesn’t support natural hot springs, so man-made onsen-like experiences are the closest option for those craving a taste of Japanese culture and relaxation. However, these spa centers do a pretty good job of recreating the onsen ambiance, making them great places for those looking to unwind in a familiar bathhouse atmosphere.
While the onsen culture in Singapore is still developing, these experiences are becoming more popular as people search for unique wellness opportunities in the city. Happy onsen!</p>
