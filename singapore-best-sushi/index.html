				<p>Welcome people. Today, we’re delving into the fascinating world of sushi in Singapore, including a look at sushi’s history in Singapore, why sushi is pricy on this island, the bustling landscape of sushi joints in Singapore and my personal recommendations and blacklist.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a seasoned sushi lover or just starting your culinary adventure, this is your ultimate guide.Join us as we explore sushi in Singapore, answering questions, sharing insights, and providing recommendations for an unforgettable culinary experience.</p>

<h4 id="how-sushi-was-brought-into-singapore">How sushi was brought into singapore</h4>

<p>The introduction of sushi to Singapore is intertwined with the city-state’s rich history of embracing diverse culinary influences. Sushi made its debut in Singapore back in the 1980s when the local dining scene started to open up to international flavors. Initially introduced by pioneering Japanese chefs, sushi gained popularity as Singaporeans developed a taste for this unique Japanese delicacy. Over the years, the demand for authentic and high-quality sushi has grown, leading to an influx of skilled sushi chefs and specialty restaurants. The globalization of cuisine, increased travel, and a growing appreciation for different culinary traditions have all played a role in establishing sushi as a beloved and integral part of Singapore’s vibrant food culture. Today, you can find a wide range of sushi establishments across the island, catering to diverse preferences and ensuring that sushi remains a staple in Singapore’s culinary landscape.</p>

<p>One of the trailblazers in introducing sushi to Singapore was Sushi Tei, which opened its doors in 1994. Situated at the then-relatively new Holland Village, Sushi Tei quickly gained attention for its diverse sushi offerings and authentic Japanese dining experience. Their signature dish, the Salmon Sashimi, became an instant hit, setting the standard for fresh and quality seafood in the local sushi scene. This pioneering establishment played a crucial role in shaping Singaporeans’ perceptions of sushi, paving the way for the multitude of sushi joints that followed. As a result, Sushi Tei holds a special place in the history of sushi in Singapore, leaving an indelible mark on the city-state’s culinary landscape. To be fair, I think Sushi Tei is bang average but everyone has their own opinions.</p>

<h4 id="average-price-of-sushi">Average price of sushi</h4>

<p>The average price of sushi in Singapore can vary widely depending on several factors, including the type of establishment, the quality of ingredients, and the overall dining experience. Here’s a general breakdown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Casual and Conveyor Belt Sushi: In more budget-friendly or casual sushi places, such as conveyor belt sushi restaurants like Sushiro or Genki Sushi, prices can start at around SGD 1.50 to SGD 3 per plate. Customers typically pay per plate, and the overall cost depends on the number and type of plates consumed.</li>
  <li>Mid-Range Sushi Restaurants: In mid-range sushi restaurants, where the focus is on a balance between quality and affordability, prices for a sushi set or per piece can range from SGD 3 to SGD 8. These establishments may offer a more extensive menu and higher-grade fish.</li>
  <li>High-End Sushi Restaurants: Upscale or fine-dining sushi restaurants in Singapore, known for premium ingredients, skilled chefs, and an elevated dining experience, can have prices that start from SGD 100 per person and can go much higher. Omakase experiences, where the chef curates a personalized menu, often come at a premium.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which brings us to the point…</p>

<h4 id="why-is-sushi-so-expensive-in-singapore">Why is sushi so expensive in singapore?</h4>

<p>The cost of sushi in Singapore, especially in higher-end establishments, can be attributed to several factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High-Quality Ingredients: Premium sushi restaurants in Singapore often prioritize using high-quality and fresh ingredients. The cost of sourcing top-notch fish, seafood, and other components contributes significantly to the overall expense.</li>
  <li>Skilled Chefs: Authentic and skillfully crafted sushi requires experienced and trained chefs. The expertise and precision involved in preparing sushi contribute to the labor costs, impacting the final price.</li>
  <li>Imported Ingredients: Many sushi ingredients, especially certain types of fish, are imported to ensure authenticity and quality. Importing these items incurs additional costs in terms of logistics, taxes, and quality control.</li>
  <li>Ambiance and Dining Experience: Upscale sushi establishments in Singapore often invest in creating a sophisticated ambiance and providing an enhanced dining experience. This includes factors like interior design, attentive service, and attention to detail, which contribute to higher operating costs.</li>
  <li>Limited Seating and High Demand: Exclusive sushi restaurants may have limited seating to maintain an intimate and exclusive atmosphere. High demand for these sought-after dining experiences can drive prices up.</li>
  <li>Rental and Operational Costs: Prime locations and well-designed spaces come at a cost. Sushi restaurants in premium areas of Singapore face higher rental and operational expenses, which are reflected in the menu prices. This is the main reason</li>
  <li>Customization and Innovation: Some upscale sushi places focus on offering unique and innovative sushi creations. The research, experimentation, and customization involved in creating distinct flavors and presentations contribute to the overall cost.</li>
  <li>Sustainability Practices: Sushi restaurants committed to sustainable and responsible sourcing practices may incur additional expenses to support environmentally friendly fishing and farming methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are more affordable sushi options in Singapore, the higher prices in certain establishments are often justified by a commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and an elevated dining experience.</p>

<h4 id="top-qualities-of-a-sushi-restaurant">Top qualities of a sushi restaurant</h4>

<p>When searching for a sushi restaurant, certain key qualities contribute to a memorable dining experience. Here are the top qualities to consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fresh and High-Quality Ingredients: Choose a sushi restaurant that prioritizes fresh and high-quality ingredients to ensure the best flavors and textures</li>
  <li>Diverse Sushi Menu: Opt for restaurants with a diverse sushi menu, offering a wide range of options to suit different preferences, including sashimi, nigiri, and specialty rolls</li>
  <li>Clean and Inviting Ambiance: A clean and inviting ambiance enhances the dining experience. Seek restaurants with a pleasant atmosphere and well-maintained interiors</li>
  <li>Omakase Options: Consider places that offer omakase, allowing the chef to curate a personalized sushi experience, showcasing their creativity and the freshest ingredients available</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="top-things-to-order-to-assess-a-sushi-restaurant">Top things to order to assess a sushi restaurant</h4>

<p>When exploring a sushi restaurant in Singapore, ordering specific items can help you assess the establishment’s quality and expertise. Here are some top things to order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Salmon (Sake) Sashimi: Opt for a plate of fresh salmon sashimi. Assess the color; it should be vibrant with a slight translucency. The texture should be firm, and the flavor should be clean and buttery. High-quality salmon should melt in your mouth.</li>
  <li>Tamago (Sweet Japanese Omelette): Tamago is a simple yet crucial dish. Its preparation reflects the chef’s attention to detail and mastery of traditional sushi elements</li>
  <li>Uni (Sea Urchin): Uni is a delicacy that showcases the restaurant’s access to high-quality and exotic ingredients. The taste and freshness are key indicators</li>
  <li>Wasabi and Soy Sauce: Pay attention to the quality of wasabi and soy sauce provided. Freshly grated or prepared wasabi and high-quality soy sauce enhance the overall experience</li>
  <li>Miso Soup: While not directly sushi, miso soup can reflect the overall attention to detail in the restaurant’s preparation of traditional Japanese dishes</li>
