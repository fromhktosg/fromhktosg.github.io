				<p>Renewing your passport is one of those thrilling administrative tasks that everyone just loves to do.</p>

<p>If you’re in Singapore, you’ll need to follow ICA passport photo guidelines carefully—because nothing’s worse than having your Singapore passport photo size rejected after waiting in line. But before you rush to the nearest passport photo services Singapore shop, you might wonder: Do you really need to go to a store, or can you take a digital passport photo Singapore from the comfort of your own home? This guide covers everything you need to know about passport renewal photo Singapore options, from official requirements to the best apps that make the process less painful. All step by step around passport renewal for common countries also included.</p>

<h3 id="how-often-should-you-renew-your-singapore-passport-or-international-passport">How often should you renew your Singapore passport or international passport?</h3>

<p>For Singapore citizens, a Singapore passport is typically valid for 10 years if issued when you’re 16 or older. If you got it before turning 16, it’s only valid for 5 years. It’s best to renew your passport about 6 months before it expires, as some countries require at least 6 months’ validity for entry.</p>

<p>For international passports, renewal rules vary by country. Most passports are valid for 5 to 10 years, with many countries also requiring at least 6 months’ validity for travel. Always check your home country’s immigration website for exact renewal guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-you-take-passport-photos-in-singapore-for-all-nationalities">Where can you take passport photos in Singapore for all nationalities?</h3>

<p>In Singapore, you can take passport photos at various locations, whether you’re a Singapore citizen or holding an international passport. Here are some options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photo Studios &amp; Shops – Many professional passport photo services Singapore locations, such as those in shopping malls, neighborhood photo studios, and even some printing shops, offer passport photos that meet ICA and other international requirements.</li>
  <li>ICA Building – If you’re renewing a Singapore passport, you can take an official passport renewal photo Singapore at the ICA building, though it’s usually more convenient to have one ready before you go.</li>
  <li>MRT Station Booths – Some MRT stations have instant photo booths where you can take digital passport photo Singapore shots, but check if they meet the required dimensions and specifications.</li>
  <li>Mobile Apps &amp; Online Services – If you’re feeling tech-savvy, you can use online services or apps to take and format your own passport photo—just make sure it follows the ICA passport photo guidelines or your local country’s guidance. More on this later</li>
  <li>Convenience Stores &amp; Printing Shops – Some outlets like Fujifilm or Kodak stores offer passport photo printing services, perfect if you already have a digital copy and just need prints.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="do-you-really-need-to-go-to-a-photo-store-to-take-a-passport-photo">Do you really need to go to a photo store to take a passport photo?</h3>

<p>TL;DR: No, you don’t need to go to a photo store. Be smart and save a couple of bucks</p>

<h3 id="what-apps-can-you-use-to-take-singapore-passport-photos">What apps can you use to take Singapore passport photos?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Singapore Passport Photo (iOS, Android) – Designed specifically for ICA requirements.</li>
  <li>證件照應用 – A simple-to-use app offering various size options, including the common two-inch and one-inch photos, as well as visa photo specifications for different countries.</li>
  <li>PersoPhoto – Online tool that adjusts your photo to official passport dimensions.</li>
  <li>Passport Photo ID Maker Studio – Lets you take, edit, and print passport photos.</li>
  <li>Biometric Passport Photo – Ensures your photo meets biometric standards.</li>
  <li>履歴書カメラ – A Japanese app with a simple interface that guides you to align your face correctly, offers skin tone and style adjustments, and allows for blemish removal.</li>
  <li>身份證照片和護照照片 – 人像裁剪 – This app provides multiple common sizes and visa specifications for different countries, allowing you to crop photos accordingly. ​</li>
  <li>Passport Photo ID Maker Studio – An app that allows you to take, edit, and print passport photos, ensuring they meet the required specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, these apps can work for other countries like UK passport photos or US passport photos.</p>

<h3 id="what-apps-are-dedicated-for-singapore-ic-renewal">What apps are dedicated for Singapore IC renewal?</h3>

<p>For Singapore IC renewal, here are the top 3 apps you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MyICA Mobile – The official ICA app allows you to renew your NRIC, apply for passports, and handle other immigration matters conveniently.</li>
  <li>Singpass Mobile – While not directly for IC renewal, this app is essential for logging into ICA services securely to submit your renewal application.</li>
  <li>IC Photo Apps (e.g., Passport Photo ID Maker Studio) – While not for renewal itself, apps like these help ensure your IC photo meets ICA’s strict requirements before submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve found these to work really well!</p>

<h3 id="should-you-edit-your-photo-after-using-one-of-the-passport-photo-id-apps">Should you edit your photo after using one of the passport photo ID apps?</h3>

<p>Ideally, no—but always check the final result.</p>

<p>Most passport photo services Singapore apps are designed to follow ICA passport photo guidelines, so heavy editing isn’t necessary. However, you should always review the output to ensure the background is evenly white, the lighting is correct (no shadows), and your facial expression meets the strict “neutral” requirement. If the app over-smooths your face or alters features unnaturally, you might need to retake the photo rather than risk rejection. Because let’s be honest—ICA isn’t going to accept a filtered, airbrushed, magazine-cover version of you.</p>

<h3 id="where-is-the-singapore-ica">Where is the Singapore ICA?</h3>

<p>The Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) of Singapore is located at:</p>

<p>📍 ICA Building
 10 Kallang Road, Singapore 208718
 (Next to Lavender MRT, Exit B)</p>

<p>This is the place where you handle passport renewal Singapore, NRIC matters, and other immigration-related services. Pro tip: If you have an appointment, arrive on time—but if you’re doing a walk-in, be prepared to wait (or better yet, just do everything online via MyICA).</p>
