### Secret McDonald tips in Singapore

+ Ask for extra sauce: Whether it's for your nuggets, fries, or burger, don’t hesitate to ask for extra sauce. You might be surprised at how generous they are when you ask!
+ Get a fresh batch of fries: If you're craving crispy fries, simply ask for a fresh batch. This way, you can enjoy fries that are hot and perfectly crispy, not the ones that have been sitting under the heat lamp.
+ Fries with no salt: If you prefer your fries without salt, just ask. They’ll make a fresh batch for you without any seasoning. You can always add your own salt later, or enjoy the natural flavor.
+ Less ice in drinks: If you're not a fan of watered-down drinks, ask for less ice. That way, your drink stays at its full strength and cool without being diluted.
+ Salt and pepper packets for seasoning: A simple trick to elevate the flavor of your food—ask for salt and pepper packets to season your fries, burgers, or even chicken. It’s a small change that makes a big difference.
+ Customize your burgers: Want to add a little extra flavor? Ask to swap ingredients—like replacing the cheese or adding more pickles or onions to your burger. It's a quick and easy way to get your meal just the way you like it.
+ Split a meal: If you're not that hungry or want to save money, you can ask to split your meal into two smaller portions. Sometimes they’ll be happy to accommodate your request.
+ Free water on request: While you’re paying for your meal, you don’t need to pay for water. Simply ask for a cup of water, and they’ll give it to you for free.
+ Order breakfast all day: In Singapore, McDonald's offers breakfast all day at selected outlets, so if you're craving an Egg McMuffin, you can get it whenever the mood strikes.
+ Discounts for students and seniors: If you’re a student or senior, don’t forget to ask about special discounts—some locations offer them, especially during certain times of the day or for specific menu items.

Happy munching!
