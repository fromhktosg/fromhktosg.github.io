Looking for a car rental in Singapore but not sure where to start?

Whether you need a cheap car rental in Singapore for a weekend getaway, a luxury car rental in Singapore to impress your in-laws or car-sharing for a quick spin, there’s a service for you. From traditional rental companies to app-based options like GetGo, renting a car has never been easier—except for the part where you navigate ERP charges, parking fees, and the eternal mystery of where to refuel before returning the car. But when should you rent a car, and is it even worth it in a city with a world-class public transport system? Let’s break down the whens, whys, hows, and even whether you can take your rented car on a quick escape to Malaysia.

### When should you rent a car in Singapore?

+ Road Trips to Malaysia – Buses are cheap, but nothing beats the freedom of driving yourself across the border. Just check if your rental company allows it.

+ Special Occasions – Need to impress on a date, show up in style for a wedding, or just want to pretend you own a luxury car for a day? Rent away.

+ Moving House or Transporting Bulky Items – Unless you enjoy squeezing a new IKEA shelf into the back of a Grab, a rental car (or van) is the way to go.

+ Exploring Singapore with Elderly Family or Kids – MRT is great, but not when you’re lugging a stroller, a week’s worth of snacks, and a very tired toddler.

+ Trying Out a Car Before Buying One – Considering car ownership? Test out different models through rental services before making a very expensive commitment.

+ Late-Night or Off-the-Grid Destinations – Not everywhere in Singapore is easy to reach by public transport, especially after midnight when trains and buses vanish.

+ Work or Business Needs – If your job requires frequent client visits or you need to transport goods, a rental can be cheaper than long-term leasing.

+ Hosting Visitors from Overseas – Show your guests around without the hassle of booking multiple Grab rides or explaining bus routes.

+ Practicing Driving After Passing Your Test – Got your license but still terrified of parallel parking? Renting a car lets you get some real-world practice before you commit to car ownership—or before you forget how to drive entirely.

### Why should you rent a car in Singapore?

+ Convenience – Say goodbye to waiting for buses, trains, or Grab rides. Renting a car lets you travel on your own schedule, especially useful for last-minute plans.
+ Comfort – Air-conditioning, personal space, and the ability to blast your favorite music—renting a car makes those long trips or city commutes a whole lot more pleasant.
+ Exploration – Singapore may be small, but there’s plenty to see beyond the usual tourist spots. Renting a car opens up places like East Coast Park, Sentosa, and even those hidden gems locals love.
+ Freedom – With a car at your disposal, you're not tied to public transport routes or timetables. Want to take a spontaneous road trip to Malaysia or just drive around for a change of scenery? Go ahead.
+ Cost-Effective for Groups – Splitting rental costs among friends or family often works out cheaper than paying for individual Grab rides. It’s the perfect choice when you’re traveling in a group.
+ Special Needs – If you're transporting bulky items, need a car for a special event, or want to try out a car model before committing to ownership, renting is the way to go.
+ Test Drive Before Buying – Unsure which car suits you? Renting lets you test different models without the pressure of making a purchase.
+ Peace of Mind on Holidays – With a rented car, you can avoid the hassle of navigating crowded public transport during peak seasons or public holidays.

### What car rental services are there?

+ Hertz Singapore – A well-known international brand offering a variety of rental options, from economy to luxury cars.
+ Avis Singapore – Another global brand with short- and long-term rental options, ideal for both business and leisure travelers.
+ Budget Car Rental – As the name suggests, this service focuses on affordable car rentals with a decent selection of vehicles.
+ Tribecar – A popular option for self-service, short-term rentals, perfect for those who just need a car for a few hours.
+ GetGo – Singapore’s largest car-sharing platform with a fully app-based experience and no deposit required.
+ BlueSG – Singapore’s electric car-sharing service, great for those looking for an eco-friendly rental option.
+ Drive.SG – An online platform that connects users with multiple rental companies for price comparisons and bookings.
+ Motorway Car Rentals – Offers luxury and exotic car rentals, great for special occasions or a taste of the high life.
+ Ride Now – A local rental company with flexible daily, weekly, and monthly rental plans.
+ SIXT Singapore – A premium international rental service with a selection of high-end vehicles.

### Which of these are better for hourly rentals?

+ GetGo – Fully app-based, no deposit required, and charges by the hour, making it great for short trips.
+ Tribecar – Offers low-cost hourly rentals, including super off-peak rates for night drives and budget-conscious users.
+ BlueSG – Singapore’s electric car-sharing service with a per-minute pricing model, ideal for ultra-short trips.

### Which of these companies have the best prices per hour?

When considering hourly car rental services in Singapore, it's essential to compare pricing structures to determine the most cost-effective option for your needs. Here's a breakdown of the hourly rates for several providers:
+ Tribecar: Offers rates starting from $0.50 per hour, making it one of the most affordable options for short-term rentals
+ GetGo: Charges begin at $3 per hour, with variations depending on the time of day and vehicle type. 
+ BlueSG: Provides electric vehicle rentals at approximately $11.45 per hour on weekdays and $12.59 per hour on weekends
+ Car Lite: Offers flexible hourly rates; specific pricing details can be found on their website. ​

Traditional car rental companies like Hertz Singapore, Avis Singapore, and Budget Car Rental typically focus on daily or longer-term rentals and may not offer competitive hourly rates. For instance, Avis's hourly rate for a standard sedan is around $60 per hour, which is significantly higher than the rates offered by car-sharing services.

In summary, for affordable hourly rentals, Tribecar and GetGo stand out as cost-effective choices. However, it's advisable to review each service's terms, conditions, and potential additional fees to ensure they align with your specific requirements.

+ Not Allowed by Car-Sharing Services – GetGo, Tribecar, and BlueSG do not allow their vehicles to be driven into Malaysia.
+ Toll Charges & Permits – Ensure your rental car has a Touch ‘n Go card for Malaysian tolls. Some companies provide it, while others require you to get one yourself.
+ Breakdown & Support – Check if roadside assistance is available in Malaysia in case of emergencies.

### Things to be aware of when renting a car and driving a rental car

<u>Before Renting<u>

+ Hidden Fees – Watch out for extra charges like insurance add-ons, late return fees, fuel surcharges, and extra mileage costs.
+ Deposit Requirements – Some companies require a security deposit, which can be quite high for premium cars.
+ Age Restrictions – Many rental companies have a minimum age requirement (usually 23-25 years old) or charge extra for younger drivers.
+ Malaysia Restrictions – Not all companies allow cross-border trips; check policies and required permits if driving to Malaysia.

<u>When Picking Up the Car<u>

+ Inspect for Damage – Check for scratches, dents, or interior stains and report them before driving to avoid being charged.
+ Fuel Level & Policy – Some rentals require you to return the car with the same fuel level or above ¼ tank (for car-sharing services like GetGo).
+ Toll Charges – Ensure the car has an IU unit for ERP and a Touch ‘n Go card if driving to Malaysia.

<u>While Driving<u>

+ Insurance Coverage – Know what your rental covers; some companies exclude damage to tyres, windows, and undercarriage.
+ Speed & Parking Rules – Singapore has strict laws and heavy fines for speeding, illegal parking, and red-light violations—rental companies will pass fines to you.
+ Fuel Type – Make sure you’re using the correct petrol type (unleaded, diesel, or premium).

<u>When Returning the Car<u>

+ Return on Time – Late returns often result in hourly or full-day penalties.
+ Cleanliness – Avoid cleaning fees by removing trash and checking for personal items before returning the car.
+ Lock & End Trip (for car-sharing services) – Ensure the car is locked via the app and that the trip has ended properly to prevent additional charges.

A little attention to detail can save you a lot of money on your rental!

Stay safe on the road, especially during monsoons!
