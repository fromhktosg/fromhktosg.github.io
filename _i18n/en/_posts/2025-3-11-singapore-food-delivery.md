Food delivery in Singapore has become a way of life—because why brave the humidity when food delivery Singapore exists? 

With an overwhelming number of options, from online food delivery Singapore platforms like GrabFood and Foodpanda to niche services specializing in Chinese food delivery Singapore, there’s something for every craving. Of course, convenience comes at a cost—hidden fees, inflated menu prices, and service charges that make you wonder if you accidentally ordered caviar. But don’t worry, there are always hacks to make the best food delivery in Singapore a little more wallet-friendly (or at least less painful). 

### What food delivery apps and services are there in Singapore?

+ GrabFood – The biggest player, offering everything from fast food to fancy restaurants.
+ Foodpanda – Known for frequent promo codes and pink delivery bags.
+ Deliveroo – Focuses on higher-end restaurants and faster delivery.
+ Oddle Eats – Connects you directly with restaurants for islandwide delivery.

If you’re craving something quick, don’t forget about fast food-specific apps like McDelivery and KFC Delivery, which make sure your burgers and fried chicken come right to your door without the need to lift a finger.

### What additional fees do food delivery apps have?

Food delivery apps in Singapore can charge various additional fees on top of the menu price. Here’s a breakdown of the common ones:

1. Delivery Fees
This is the most common extra charge, varying based on factors like distance, restaurant choice, and demand. Typically ranges from $1.50 to $6, but can spike during peak hours or surge pricing periods.

2. Service Fees
Most apps charge a service fee, which can be $0.99 to $2. It covers operational costs like maintaining the app and processing payments.

3. Booking Fees
Apps like Oddle Eats may add a small booking fee, usually around $1 to $2, especially for special orders or reservations for larger groups.

4. Packaging Fees
Some apps (especially for premium restaurants or meal kits) charge a packaging fee to cover the cost of containers and other packaging materials, usually around $0.50 to $2.

5. Surge Pricing
During peak times (like weekends or lunch/dinner hours), some platforms apply surge pricing to the delivery fee. This can increase the total delivery cost by 20-30%.

6. Tip/Gratuity
While optional, some platforms allow you to add a tip for the delivery rider, typically ranging from $1 to $5, depending on your generosity (or guilt).

7. Subscription Fees
Apps like Deliveroo Plus and GrabFood’s subscription plans offer benefits like free delivery and exclusive deals for an annual or monthly fee, usually $10 to $15 per month.

### How much extra are food delivery apps versus usual restaurant prices?

Food delivery apps in Singapore typically charge more than usual restaurant prices, thanks to additional fees and commissions. Here's a breakdown of the extra costs you might face:

1. Delivery Fees

These can range from $1.50 to $6, depending on distance, time, and surge pricing. This is an obvious markup on the usual in-store dining experience, where there are no delivery charges.

2. Service Fees

Service fees can range from $0.99 to $2, which are applied on top of the order total. Restaurants don't usually charge these when you dine in.

3. Menu Price Markup

Some restaurants increase their menu prices for deliveries. This can be around 5% to 20% higher than in-store prices to cover the platform’s commission and other operational costs. While some restaurants keep their prices the same, it's common to see higher prices for delivery.

4. Packaging Fees

For takeaway or delivery, some restaurants add a packaging fee (usually $0.50 to $2) to cover the cost of containers and cutlery. This isn’t something you’d pay if you dine in.

5. Subscription Fees

If you subscribe to premium delivery services like Deliveroo Plus or GrabFood’s subscription, you might pay $10 to $15 per month. While this can save you on delivery fees, it still adds to the overall cost.

### What hacks are there for cheaper food delivery?

+ Call the Restaurant Directly: Some restaurants offer cheaper or direct delivery services, avoiding high app fees.
+ Use Promo Codes: Keep an eye on app promotions or sign up for newsletters to get discount codes.
+ Join Loyalty Programs: Programs like GrabRewards or PandaPerks offer discounts or free delivery for frequent users.
+ Order in Bulk: Group orders often come with discounts or waived delivery fees.
+ Sign Up for Subscriptions: Plans like Deliveroo Plus or GrabFood’s subscription offer free delivery and perks.
+ Avoid Peak Hours: Order during off-peak times to avoid surge pricing.
+ Compare Apps: Different platforms may offer better prices or lower fees for the same restaurant.

### Should you get a food delivery app subscription?

Whether or not you should get a food delivery app subscription depends on how often you order delivery. Here’s a quick breakdown:

Yes, Get a Subscription If:

+ You order frequently (e.g., a few times a week). Subscriptions like GrabFood Plus or Deliveroo Plus offer free delivery and exclusive discounts, which can quickly offset the monthly fee.
+ You want to avoid fluctuating delivery charges, especially during peak hours when prices can surge.
+ You want additional perks like loyalty rewards, cashback, or access to exclusive deals.

No, Don’t Get a Subscription If:

+ You order delivery only occasionally. In this case, the subscription fee may not be worth it, as you can simply rely on promotions or one-off discounts.
+ You prefer variety and like to switch between different apps. Subscriptions are usually tied to one platform, and you may miss out on better deals elsewhere.

Let’s break down the math for GrabFood Plus to help you decide if it's worth it.

<u>GrabFood Plus Subscription<u>

Cost: $12.98 per month (before GST).

Benefits:
+ Free delivery on all orders (minimum order may apply).
+ Exclusive deals and discounts for members.
+ Priority customer support.

Without GrabFood Plus:

+ Average Delivery Fee: $2.50 to $4.50 per order (could vary depending on time and distance).
+ Average Meal Cost: Let’s assume each order costs around $15 (this could be higher for premium restaurants).

Scenario 1: Ordering Once a Week (4 times a month)

Without Subscription:
+ Delivery Fee: $3 per order x 4 orders = $12
+ Total for the Month (without subscription): $15 x 4 (meal cost) + $12 (delivery fees) = $72

With Subscription:
+ GrabFood Plus Subscription: $12.98 per month (plus GST, let’s say around $13.90)
+ Total for the Month (with subscription): $13.90 (subscription) + $60 (meal cost, $15 x 4) = $73.90

Verdict: In this scenario, a subscription doesn’t save you money if you're only ordering 4 times a month. You'd actually spend a little more with the subscription ($73.90 vs. $72).

Do the maths!

### Should you tip for food delivery in Singapore?

I tip if it rains. Else wise, tipping culture is not big in Singapore.

I’m lazy but most times I can’t stomach paying a platform fee to have my food delivered. It's even more egregious in the US. Good thing we’re in Singapore
