## Local Favourites

Here are some distinctly Singaporean fillings and flavours that make **local donuts in Singapore** so irresistible:

Western donuts typically come filled with vanilla cream, chocolate, or fruity jelly. But here in Singapore, the flavours lean local — pandan, salted egg, and Milo rule the display cases.
