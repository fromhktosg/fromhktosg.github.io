Singapore’s monsoon season isn’t just a weather phenomenon—it’s practically a national pastime. 

We love talking about the weather. If you enjoy stepping out into clear skies only to be drenched five minutes later, monsoon season in Singapore has got you covered. With the Northeast monsoon bringing months of relentless rain, occasional floods, and that ever-familiar damp sock experience, it’s no wonder people constantly search for the Singapore monsoon forecast or wonder when does it rain in Singapore (hint: all the time). But before you break out the ark, let’s take a look at why the rainy season in Singapore is so persistent, how it impacts daily life, and whether checking the weather in Singapore today actually helps. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t.

### Why is it raining so much in Singapore in March?

If you’re wondering why it’s raining so much in Singapore in March, you’re not alone. March sits at the tail end of the Northeast Monsoon season, which usually lasts from December to early March. During this period, lingering monsoon surges can still bring heavy rain and thunderstorms. Additionally, March marks the transition to the Inter-monsoon season, where warm temperatures and high humidity lead to frequent afternoon showers and even sudden thunderstorms. Combine that with climate change and the usual unpredictability of tropical weather, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for feeling like you live inside a rain cloud. So, if you were hoping for dry, sunny days—well, maybe check back in June.

### How long will this monsoon rain last for?

Singapore’s monsoon rain should last about one to two more weeks, with the Northeast Monsoon season ending by mid-March. But don’t ditch the umbrella yet—Inter-monsoon season kicks in right after, bringing unpredictable downpours.

To stay dry during the monsoon season in Singapore, try these:
