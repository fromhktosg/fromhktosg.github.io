From the aroma of freshly brewed kopi to the comforting warmth of kaya toast, these establishments offer a slice of Singapore’s heritage in every cup.

As we explore must-try kopitiam dishes and dive into their payment methods, you’ll see why kopitiams continue to be a beloved part of Singapore's culinary landscape.

### How do you pay in Kopitiams?

+ Pay at the counter – Most kopitiams require you to pay at the counter after placing your order. You'll receive a receipt with a number, which corresponds to your food order.
+ Cash payment – Many kopitiams still operate on a cash-only basis, so make sure to have cash on hand before placing your order.
+ Card payment – Some kopitiams, especially those in more modern locations, accept credit or debit cards for payment.
+ QR Code/Payment Apps – Increasingly, you can pay via mobile payment apps like PayNow, GrabPay, or AliPay, simply by scanning a QR code.
+ Order and pay at table – In some kopitiams with a more café-style setup, you may place your order at the table and pay through a digital system or with the waiter when your meal arrives.
+ FairPrice App – Certain kopitiam chains like Toast Box and Koufu allow you to order and pay through the FairPrice app. This is particularly convenient for those looking to avoid long lines and streamline their payments with digital wallets.

### What’s the difference between a Kopitiam and a food court?

The main differences between a kopitiam and a food court are in their origins, food offerings, and atmosphere:

+ Origins: Kopitiams are traditional, local coffee shops offering simple, nostalgic fare like kaya toast and kopi. Food courts are modern, larger setups in malls with a diverse range of local and international cuisines.
+ Food: Kopitiams focus on local breakfast items and comfort food. Food courts offer a variety of dishes from different cuisines, including fast food.
+ Atmosphere: Kopitiams are small, intimate, and retro. Food courts are larger, more modern, and often part of commercial complexes.
+ Ownership: Kopitiams are often family-run, while food courts are managed by larger operators or corporations.

Honestly, though, these two are merging together, and there’s not much of a difference at times.

### What to order at Kopitiams?

+ Toast & Coffee – Kaya toast with soft-boiled eggs and a cup of local kopi or teh typically costs around $2.50 to $5.
+ Mixed Rice / Economy Rice – A plate of mixed rice with a variety of dishes generally costs around $3 to $5, depending on the choices.
+ Drinks – Kopi, teh, Milo, or other local drinks are usually priced between $1.50 to $2.50.
+ Ban Mian – A bowl of ban mian (noodles in broth with vegetables and meat) is typically around $4 to $6.
+ Western Grill – Western meals like grilled chicken or fish with sides generally cost around $6 to $15.
+ Wonton Noodles – A bowl of wonton noodles with dumplings and char siew is usually priced at $4 to $6.
+ Cantonese-Style BBQ Roast Meat Rice – A plate of BBQ roast meat rice (with char siew, roast pork, or duck) costs around $5 to $8.

### Are kopitiams disappearing?

While kopitiams are not exactly disappearing, they are facing challenges. With the rise of modern food courts, cafes, and changing consumer habits, traditional kopitiams are slowly being overshadowed in certain areas. Many younger generations prefer the convenience and variety of food courts or trendy cafés. Additionally, the high cost of renting shop spaces has forced some kopitiams to close or relocate.

However, despite these challenges, kopitiams continue to thrive in certain parts of Singapore, especially in residential areas, and there is still a strong nostalgic appeal for locals who appreciate the traditional offerings. They may be evolving or adapting, but for now, they remain an integral part of Singapore’s food culture.

### Are kopitiams getting more expensive?

Kopitiams are getting more expensive, though not to the same extent as high-end restaurants. As with most businesses, rising costs of ingredients, labor, and rent have caused prices to gradually increase over the years. Traditional items like kaya toast, kopi, and mixed rice are no longer as affordable as they used to be, with some prices rising by $2-3 or more which are significant increments for the average joe.

While the price hikes are noticeable, kopitiams still offer a more affordable dining option compared to many other types of eateries in Singapore. However, customers are increasingly feeling the pinch, especially when they’re used to paying lower prices for simple, comfort food.

I personally don’t like Kopitiams but might visit once a month. What about you?
