Hawker centers you should avoid in Singapore

# Hawker Centers You Should Avoid in Singapore

Not all hawker centers in Singapore are created equal. While most offer great food at affordable prices, a few are either overpriced, tourist traps, or suffer from hygiene or quality issues. Here are some hawker centers you might want to avoid — and why.

## 1. Lau Pa Sat
- **Location**: Raffles Place / CBD  
- **Why avoid**: Beautiful colonial architecture, but the food is often **overpriced and catered more for tourists than locals**. You’ll find satay and seafood stalls charging restaurant-level prices with inconsistent quality. Great for photos, not for value.

## 2. Newton Food Centre
- **Location**: Newton  
- **Why avoid**: Famously featured in *Crazy Rich Asians*, but also known for **pushy vendors and inflated prices**. Many stalls hike up seafood prices, and the experience can feel more like a tourist trap than an authentic hawker outing.

## 3. Telok Ayer Market (also called Lau Pa Sat Extension)
- **Location**: Telok Ayer  
- **Why avoid**: Not to be confused with Lau Pa Sat itself, this satellite area **lacks variety and feels sterile**. It's more a CBD lunch spot with average food and high prices, rather than a true hawker experience.

## 4. Esplanade Mall Food Court (not a true hawker, but sometimes marketed as one)
- **Location**: Esplanade / Marina Bay  
- **Why avoid**: Marketed with hawker-style décor, but in reality, **prices are much higher** than traditional centers and food quality can be hit-or-miss. Feels more like a themed food court.

## 5. Makansutra Gluttons Bay
- **Location**: Marina Bay  
- **Why avoid**: Scenic location, but **limited stalls and premium pricing** for basic local fare. Portions can be small, and many locals would rather go to a true neighborhood hawker center.
