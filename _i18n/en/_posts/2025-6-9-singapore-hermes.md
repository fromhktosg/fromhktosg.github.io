## How to Secure a Bag Appointment

### Step 1: Understand the Appointment-Only Policy

- Hermès does not sell iconic handbags like the Birkin or Kelly over the counter without an appointment.
- These highly coveted bags are offered based on availability, discretion, and client purchase history.

### Step 2: Know Which Boutique Requires Appointments

- In Singapore, bag appointments for high-demand pieces are typically handled at the **Liat Towers** boutique.
- The **Marina Bay Sands** location may occasionally offer bags, but appointments are rarely accepted for first-time clients.

### Step 3: Book Online via the Hermès Singapore Website

- Visit the [Hermès Singapore website](https://www.hermes.com/sg) and navigate to the **"Request a Leather Goods Appointment"** section.
- Appointments are usually released daily and can only be booked 1 day in advance.
- The booking window opens at **10:30 AM SGT**—log in early and refresh frequently.

### Step 4: Fill in the Appointment Request Form

- Select your preferred boutique (usually Liat Towers).
- Provide personal details including name, phone number, and email.
- Submit your request and wait for confirmation via email or SMS.

### Step 5: Check for Confirmation

- If your appointment is confirmed, you’ll receive a designated time slot.
- If not, try again the following day—demand is extremely high and slots are limited.

### Step 6: What to Expect During the Appointment

- A sales associate will meet you privately to discuss your preferences and available inventory.
- You may not be shown a Birkin or Kelly immediately—availability is based on factors like client profile, demand, and product allocation.
- Be polite, patient, and open to suggestions (such as other styles like the Picotin, Lindy, or Constance).

### Step 7: Build a Purchase History

- Consistent purchases of Hermès goods (such as scarves, shoes, belts, or homeware) help establish your client profile.
- Loyalty and diversity of purchases over time may increase your chances of being offered a quota bag.

### Step 8: Additional Tips

- Dress elegantly but not extravagantly—Hermès values discretion.
- Avoid asking directly for a Birkin or Kelly at the start of your appointment.
- Let your sales associate get to know your tastes and preferences organically over several visits.

## Pricing Landscape and Taxes

### General Pricing of Hermès in Singapore

Hermès bags and accessories in Singapore follow a premium pricing structure similar to other global fashion capitals. Popular items such as the Picotin, Garden Party, and Evelyne generally range from **SGD 3,000 to SGD 7,000**, while quota bags like the **Birkin, Kelly, and Constance** start from approximately **SGD 13,000**, depending on size, leather type, and hardware.

Small leather goods, like cardholders and wallets, usually fall between **SGD 600 and SGD 2,000**, while silk scarves are priced around **SGD 500 to SGD 700**. Prices for ready-to-wear fashion and shoes vary more widely depending on materials and seasonality.

### Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Singapore

All Hermès purchases in Singapore are subject to **8% GST** as of 2025. This tax is automatically included in the displayed retail price. The GST applies uniformly across all categories, from handbags and accessories to apparel and home goods.

### Comparing Prices Across Cities

While Hermès maintains global pricing parity, **Singapore is typically more expensive** than Paris, which often offers the most favorable base prices due to local VAT structures. Compared to **Hong Kong**, Singapore’s prices are slightly higher due to GST and less frequent currency promotions. **Tokyo** can also offer competitive pricing depending on currency exchange rates, but language barriers and stock availability may be limitations for some shoppers.

For Singaporean residents, local convenience and availability often offset minor pricing differences. For international shoppers, particularly those visiting multiple fashion capitals, planning Hermès purchases in **France** may still provide the best value.

### Tourist GST Refunds

Tourists who spend a minimum of **SGD 100 in a single receipt** at Hermès can claim a **GST refund** at Changi Airport before departure. The refund is processed through the **Electronic Tourist Refund Scheme (eTRS)** and can be claimed via kiosks located within the airport terminals.

Shoppers must present:
- A valid passport
- Original receipts
- Purchased items for inspection if requested

The GST refund amount is subject to processing fees and may be credited to a credit card or issued in cash, depending on the traveler’s selected method.

## Pre-Loved and Resale Market Trends

The pre-loved Hermès market in Singapore has grown into a thriving ecosystem supported by a mix of physical boutiques and digital platforms. Trusted resellers such as **Madison Avenue**, **HuntStreet Singapore**, **LuxLexicon**, and **EcoRing** offer a curated selection of authenticated Hermès bags, often accompanied by certification, condition grading, and provenance details.

Online marketplaces like **Vestiaire Collective**, **Reebonz (resale)**, and **The Fifth Collection** provide greater accessibility for buyers who prefer browsing and purchasing luxury pieces from the comfort of home. These platforms typically offer robust buyer protection and independent authentication to ensure item legitimacy.

Pricing in the secondary market can be volatile, driven by **demand, rarity, condition**, and **seasonal trends**. Popular models such as the **Birkin 25 in Togo leather** or **Kelly in Sellier construction** frequently command premiums above their original retail price—especially for hard-to-get colors or hardware combinations. Meanwhile, less popular sizes or styles may be priced lower than boutique rates, offering opportunities for value-conscious collectors.

Some Hermès pieces are now viewed as **investment assets**, with price appreciation over time outpacing traditional luxury items. This has led to increased interest from both fashion enthusiasts and investors looking for stable, tangible assets with global desirability. However, buyers should always exercise due diligence by requesting authentication certificates, inspecting photos closely, and purchasing from reputable sellers with clear return policies.

## Style Picks Beyond the Birkin and Kelly

While the Birkin and Kelly bags dominate the headlines, many Singaporean shoppers are turning their attention to other Hermès icons that offer versatility, style, and slightly better accessibility.

### Constance Bag

The **Constance** remains one of the most sought-after non-quota bags, recognizable by its sleek silhouette and prominent "H" clasp. Available in various sizes, including the **Mini Constance 18** and **Constance 24**, this bag is a favorite among working professionals and style influencers in Singapore due to its structured elegance and crossbody convenience. Popular materials include **Epsom leather** and **Swift**, often in neutral or pastel tones suitable for tropical climates.

### Silk Scarves and Twillys

Hermès’ **silk scarves** and **Twillys** are staples in many Singaporean wardrobes. Their vibrant prints and seasonal designs make them ideal for expressing individuality without committing to big-ticket items. Twillys are frequently used to wrap bag handles, offering both protection and flair, while classic carré scarves double as neckwear, headbands, or accessories tied onto handbags for added color.

### Oran Sandals

The **Oran sandal** is a perennial favorite in Singapore thanks to its minimalistic design and lightweight comfort—ideal for the city’s year-round tropical weather. Available in a wide range of colors and leathers, the Oran has become a go-to summer shoe for both casual and resort settings. It’s often paired with linen sets, flowy dresses, or upscale casual wear for a polished yet effortless look.

### H Belt

The reversible **Hermès H belt** is another status-signaling accessory popular with both men and women in Singapore. It offers subtle branding, quality craftsmanship, and practicality for both workwear and weekend attire. Shoppers often opt for **classic black/gold** or **etoupe/white** combinations to match their wardrobe.

### Local Style Preferences

Singaporean shoppers tend to favor **neutral tones** like gold, etoupe, noir, and trench for their versatility, along with seasonal pastels for a fresh look. Functionality plays a big role, with lightweight accessories and crossbody options preferred for ease of movement in the city. While Hermès pieces are often styled for special occasions, it’s not uncommon to see scarves, sandals, and even mini bags integrated into **everyday wear**, reflecting a balance of luxury and lifestyle.

## Hermès and Singapore’s Luxury Culture

In Singapore’s evolving luxury landscape, Hermès holds a unique and prestigious position. Known for its quiet elegance and storied craftsmanship, the brand resonates strongly with both long-time collectors and the new generation of luxury consumers.

### Rise of High-Net-Worth Individuals

Singapore is home to a growing population of high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), fueled by its robust finance sector, strong global connectivity, and status as a wealth management hub. As the number of affluent residents increases, so does the appetite for ultra-luxury goods—and Hermès sits at the very top of that pyramid. The brand's exclusivity, long waitlists, and craftsmanship narrative align perfectly with the mindset of consumers who value rarity and legacy over hype.

### Luxury Gifting Culture

Hermès also plays a notable role in Singapore’s luxury gifting traditions. In corporate circles, gifting high-end accessories such as **Hermès ties, scarves, or fragrances** has become an unspoken language of appreciation and prestige. These gifts are seen not just as tokens of goodwill, but as a subtle nod to one’s refined taste and social awareness. Among family and friends, gifting a Hermès wallet or belt for milestones—like weddings or business launches—is increasingly common.

### Status Symbol in Corporate and Social Settings

Carrying a Hermès item—be it a Birkin, a Kelly, or even a Constance wallet—is more than a fashion statement in Singapore; it's often a reflection of one's status and professional achievement. In high-powered meetings, boardrooms, or social galas, these pieces subtly signal credibility, success, and belonging within elite circles. Men and women alike lean into Hermès’ understated luxury to project influence without overt flamboyance.

### Influence on Local Style and Aspirations

Beyond tangible products, Hermès influences the broader aspirations of luxury consumers in Singapore. The brand has come to represent more than just fashion—it embodies a lifestyle of refinement, patience, and connoisseurship. This ethos is particularly appealing in a society that values discretion, discipline, and long-term investment over fast trends.

### Integration with Singapore’s Luxury Infrastructure

Hermès’ presence at key luxury retail locations like Orchard Road and Marina Bay Sands further cements its alignment with Singapore’s premium shopping ecosystem. These locations are often frequented by tourists and locals alike, who view a visit to Hermès as both a retail experience and a cultural ritual. The brand also occasionally collaborates with regional artists or participates in lifestyle events that elevate its resonance within the luxury scene.

## The Future of Hermès in Singapore

Hermès continues to evolve in response to changing consumer behaviors, economic shifts, and cultural dynamics, and its trajectory in Singapore reflects many of these global luxury trends with a distinctly local flavor.

### Embracing Sustainability in Luxury

Sustainability is becoming a key consideration for Singapore’s affluent consumers, and Hermès is gradually incorporating environmentally responsible practices into its offerings. From the use of responsibly sourced leathers to investments in circular economy efforts like repairs and longevity-focused craftsmanship, the brand is subtly aligning itself with Singapore’s broader green ambitions. Eco-conscious consumers are starting to see luxury not only as an indulgence, but also as a long-term commitment to quality and ethical production.

### Rise of Digital Experiences

As one of the most connected cities in the world, Singapore provides a prime environment for Hermès to explore digital touchpoints. The brand has already enhanced its e-commerce presence with curated collections and exclusive online drops, appealing to tech-savvy shoppers who expect seamless digital service. Interactive storytelling, virtual try-ons, and appointment scheduling tools are increasingly integrated into the local Hermès experience, offering both convenience and personalization.

### Influence of the Next Generation

Younger luxury buyers in Singapore, including Gen Z professionals and affluent millennials, are reshaping the narrative around Hermès. While many still aspire to iconic items like the Birkin or Kelly, there is also a noticeable pivot toward smaller leather goods, wearable accessories, and limited-run artistic collaborations. These customers are often less focused on status signaling and more drawn to heritage, individuality, and slow fashion values.

### Potential Boutique Expansions

There is growing anticipation around the possibility of new Hermès retail concepts or boutique expansions in Singapore. With the country’s luxury retail landscape remaining strong, especially in areas like Orchard Road, Marina Bay, and Changi Airport’s Jewel, Hermès is well-positioned to innovate its physical footprint. Pop-up concepts, thematic installations, and seasonal exhibitions could further amplify the brand’s visibility and cultural presence.

### Local Excitement Around Limited-Time Collections

Hermès continues to generate buzz through capsule collections, artist collaborations, and region-specific designs. When unique colors or seasonal pieces are released in Singapore, queues often form even before store openings. These exclusives deepen customer engagement and give local collectors a chance to own a slice of the brand’s ongoing creative journey.

Happy shopping!
