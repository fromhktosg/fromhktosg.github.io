Grab and Gojek have changed the way we get around, replacing the old-fashioned taxi hunt with the magic of ride-hailing apps.

Whether you’re booking a GrabCar, a GrabTaxi, or wondering which app offers the cheapest ride in Singapore, there’s a service for almost every need—except maybe teleportation. But how different are ride-hailing apps from regular taxi apps, and do they actually make money, or are they just burning investor cash? And if you’ve got a pet, a baby, or an unreasonable number of suitcases, how do you even book the right ride? Let’s break down the chaos of Singapore’s ride-hailing scene and figure out what’s worth your time (and your wallet).

### What are ride-hailing apps?

Ride-hailing apps like Grab Singapore and Gojek Singapore let you book rides through your phone, connecting you with nearby drivers—at a price that may surge when you need it most. Unlike taxis, these apps offer different vehicle options, from budget to premium, and use dynamic pricing instead of fixed fares. They’re a modern, convenient way to get around—just be ready for the occasional sticker shock.

### How are taxi apps different from ride-hailing apps?

Taxi apps connect you to metered cabs, while ride-hailing apps like Grab Singapore and Gojek Singapore let you book both private-hire cars and taxis. With options like GrabTaxi, you can still get a traditional cab through a ride-hailing app, but services like GrabCar use dynamic pricing that fluctuates with demand. Ride-hailing apps also offer more vehicle choices, from budget rides to premium cars—though no app can guarantee your driver won’t cancel at the last minute. In short, taxi apps stick to old-school metered fares, while ride-hailing apps give you more options (and sometimes, more surprises).

### What types of services do ride-hailing apps provide?

+ Ride-hailing apps in Singapore offer a variety of services to cater to different needs:
+ Standard Rides – Most apps, like Grab Singapore and Gojek Singapore, offer basic ride options, from budget-friendly GrabCar to slightly more luxurious choices.
+ Taxi Booking – You can book traditional metered taxis through apps like ComfortDelGro and Grab (via GrabTaxi).
+ Carpooling – Apps like Ryde provide carpooling services, letting you share a ride with others for a lower fare.
+ Premium Rides – For those wanting a little more luxury, services like GrabPremium offer higher-end cars.
+ Pet-Friendly Rides – Ryde and Gojek Singapore offer pet-friendly options for those traveling with animals.
+ Food and Package Delivery – Grab extends beyond rides, offering GrabFood and GrabExpress for deliveries.

| **App**              | **Strengths**                                              | **Drawbacks**                                           |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Grab Singapore**    | Most widely used, offers a range of services beyond transport | Surge pricing, occasional driver cancellations        |

### Which of these apps is the cheapest?

The cheapest ride-hailing app in Singapore often depends on several factors, such as the time of day, location, and demand. However, generally speaking:
Gojek Singapore is often considered one of the cheapest options due to its competitive pricing and regular promotions. They tend to offer more affordable fares, especially during off-peak hours or with special discounts.

TADA also positions itself as an affordable option since it operates with a commission-free model, which can result in lower fares for passengers.

Grab tends to have higher fares due to its more extensive range of services (e.g., GrabFood, GrabExpress) and premium options, although it does have occasional discounts and promotions.
How do I order a ride if I have a dog or a cat?

To travel with pets on Grab, you can use the GrabPet service, which is available in select regions. When booking a ride, simply select GrabPet as your ride option, and your driver will be prepared to accommodate your furry friend. Always check with the driver beforehand to confirm if pets are allowed, as policies may vary. Other competitors have similar offerings

### How do I order a ride if I have a baby?

To order a ride with a baby, use GrabFamily on the Grab app, which offers cars equipped with child-friendly features like car seats. Alternatively, you can request a regular ride and bring your own car seat, but it's always good to confirm with the driver beforehand.

### How do I order a ride if I have two suitcases?

To order a ride with two suitcases, you can choose a larger vehicle option like GrabXL or Gojek XL for more luggage space. However, a normal car can generally fit two medium-sized suitcases, so you can also select a standard ride and confirm with the driver if there's enough space for your bags.

### How do I order a ride if I have four suitcases?

To order a ride with four suitcases, it's generally not possible in a standard vehicle. You would need to select a larger option like GrabXL or Gojek XL, but even then, it is not possible to fit four large suitcases. It’s best to just order two Grabs. 

### How far in advance should I schedule my ride?

You can schedule a ride on most ride-hailing apps, like Grab and Gojek, up to 7 days in advance. However, it's recommended to book at least 30 minutes to an hour before your desired time to ensure availability. Alternatively, you can just order and wait a few minutes, especially during non-peak times when rides are usually available faster.

### Can you still hail a taxi from the streets these days?

Grab prioritizes riders based on factors like proximity to available drivers, ride type (e.g., GrabCar, GrabTaxi, GrabXL), and surge pricing. Riders in high-demand areas or during peak times may be prioritized with higher fares due to surge pricing. Additionally, riders with a higher GrabRewards status may find it easier to get a ride, as frequent users or those with better ratings are often given priority.

### Do ride-hailing apps make money?

Ride-hailing apps like Grab and Gojek are not yet profitable, despite generating significant revenue. They prioritize growth and market share, often spending heavily on promotions and incentives. While they aim to become profitable through diversification and efficiency, many still have no clear path to profitability.

Personally, I only take grabs in urgent situations or to the airport. What about you?
