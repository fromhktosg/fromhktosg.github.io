Department stores in Singapore are more than just giant air-conditioned buildings—they're practically national landmarks.

From the legendary Takashimaya Singapore to the ever-reliable Tangs Singapore and Isetan Singapore, these shopping giants have been quietly holding the retail scene together while everyone else obsesses over pop-ups and TikTok shops. Whether you're hunting for a good deal during a Singapore department store sale or just pretending you’re in Tokyo while browsing at BHG Singapore, there’s something oddly comforting about the glitz and chaos of these multi-level playgrounds. Especially if you're roaming Orchard Road department stores and wondering how many escalators one human can ride in an afternoon. So if you’re looking for the best department stores Singapore has to offer—or perhaps just a cool escape from the sun—we’ve got your retail therapy sorted.

### What is the difference between a mall and a department store?

<u>Department Store<u>

+ Definition: A single large store that sells a wide variety of products across different categories (like clothes, electronics, cosmetics, home goods) under one roof.
+ Examples: Takashimaya, Isetan, Robinsons (RIP), Tangs.
+ Structure: Split into departments (hence the name) — e.g., women’s fashion, men's shoes, kitchenware — but it’s still one store.
+ Payment: You usually check out at one main cashier system for all departments.
+ Ownership: Owned and run by a single company or brand.

<u>🛍️ Mall (Shopping Mall)v

+ Definition: A large complex or building that houses many different stores, including department stores, restaurants, cafes, salons, and entertainment spots.
+ Examples: ION Orchard, VivoCity, Plaza Singapura.
+ Structure: Like a marketplace of stores, each operated separately — e.g., Zara, Uniqlo, Sephora, H&M.
+ Payment: You pay at each individual store.
+ Ownership: Owned by a developer or property group; tenants rent space.

🔍 TL;DR:
A department store is one store with many departments.
A mall is many stores in one place.

### 📌 Department Stores Near Me (Islandwide)

If you're searching for department stores near me Singapore, you’ll likely stumble upon Metro, which has branches in suburbs like Causeway Point and Paragon—perfect for avoiding Orchard crowds.

### Why are so many department stores Japanese?

+ The Japanese invented shopping as an art form – Department stores like Isetan and Takashimaya aren't just retail hubs; they’re temples of quiet consumerism where socks, skincare, and sashimi coexist in perfect harmony.

+ Brand trust and obsession with quality – Japanese department stores built their reputation on polite service, impeccable organization, and not selling you a shirt that falls apart after one wash. In other words, they’re the answer to “why can’t everything just work properly?”

+ Food basements (Depachika) are life-changing – Once you’ve experienced the prepared meals, snacks, and Japanese fruits that cost more than your rent, it’s easy to understand the appeal. Singapore said: "Yes, we’ll take that. Put it in Orchard Road."

+ Cultural connection and consumer demand – Singaporeans love Japan. Japan loves retail. It was only a matter of time before Japanese department stores became local favourites—especially among those who plan their holidays around Don Don Donki openings.

+ Local stores needed an upgrade – No shade to the old-school local names, but the arrival of Japanese department stores injected style, precision, and just enough quirk to make going to a Singapore department store sale feel like a lifestyle choice.

🇯🇵 1. Takashimaya Singapore

+ Opened: 1993
+ Location: Ngee Ann City, Orchard Road
+ Fun fact: The first and only Takashimaya department store in Southeast Asia. It helped redefine Orchard Road department stores with its massive size, Japanese service, and that glorious basement food hall.

🇯🇵 2. Isetan Singapore

+ Opened: 1972
+ Locations: Scotts (Orchard), Katong, Serangoon (NEX), Tampines (Tampines Mall), City Hall (Raffles City)
+ Fun fact: The first Japanese department store to enter Singapore. It’s now one of the most widely distributed, with multiple outlets answering everyone's "department stores near me Singapore" search.

### Are department stores struggling in Singapore?

Yes—and it’s not just your imagination or the echo in a half-empty cosmetics hall.

1. Declining Footfall & Sales
According to a 2023 report by Statista, retail sales in department stores in Singapore fell by over 30% between 2018 and 2022. While there was some recovery in 2023 with a 9.6% year-on-year increase (thanks to revenge shopping), sales still haven't returned to pre-pandemic levels.

2. E-commerce eats everything
E-commerce in Singapore was valued at SGD 6 billion in 2023, and is projected to hit SGD 10 billion by 2027. Meanwhile, department stores are still trying to convince people their online catalogues won’t crash on checkout.

3. The Robinsons Fallout
When Robinsons closed in 2020 after 162 years in Singapore, it was a sign of the times. The once-iconic chain couldn’t keep up with rising costs and changing shopper habits—despite being one of the most recognised city hall department stores Singapore ever had.

4. Store Closures
Between 2020–2022, OG and Metro scaled down by shuttering multiple outlets. Metro now operates fewer stores, focusing mainly on suburban malls (a.k.a. hoping to catch you right after your bubble tea run).

5. The Japanese Exception
Meanwhile, Takashimaya Singapore’s revenue reportedly crossed SGD 500 million in 2022, thanks to loyal shoppers, Japanese food halls, and the general vibe of being better at everything. Isetan, despite store closures in other countries, continues to operate 5 outlets across Singapore—holding the fort in the age of “department stores near me Singapore” searches.
