The NBA may not be Singapore’s national obsession, but basketball still has a loyal following here.

Whether you're checking NBA scores, keeping up with NBA standings, or planning your week around the NBA schedule, there’s no shortage of ways to stay updated. Fans eagerly follow the NBA Playoffs and NBA Finals, while the NBA All-Star Game gives everyone an excuse to watch players show off (even more than usual). From catching the latest NBA news to searching for an NBA live stream at odd hours, Singaporeans have found ways to stay connected to the game. And if all that isn’t enough, there are even local courts where you can attempt your own version of an NBA highlight—just with a little less dunking.

### Is basketball popular in Singapore?

Basketball has a decent following in Singapore, especially with the NBA's global appeal. While it’s not as big as football, local courts stay busy, and big NBA events like the NBA Playoffs and NBA Finals always draw attention.

### Why do Singaporeans like watching basketball / watching the NBA?

Singaporeans like watching basketball and the NBA because:
+ Fast-paced action – Non-stop movement, dunks, and buzzer-beaters keep things exciting.
+ Star players – Global icons like LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Giannis make the game entertaining.
+ NBA drama – Trades, rivalries, and off-court stories add to the entertainment.
+ Big events – The NBA Playoffs, NBA Finals, and NBA All-Star Game bring high-stakes action.
+ Easy to watch – With NBA live streams and highlights online, it’s accessible anytime.
+ Streetball culture – Many Singaporeans play casually, so watching the pros is inspiring.
+ Betting and fantasy leagues – Some follow the game for wagers or fantasy basketball fun.
+ Global influence – The NBA’s marketing ensures its presence everywhere, including Singapore.

### Top NBA teams that Singaporean support

+ Los Angeles Lakers – One of the most iconic teams in NBA history, with a legacy from Magic Johnson to Kobe Bryant and now LeBron James. Their championships and Hollywood appeal make them a global favorite.
+ Golden State Warriors – The team that revolutionized basketball with Stephen Curry’s insane three-pointers. Their dominance in the 2010s made them one of the most popular franchises worldwide, including in Singapore.
+ Chicago Bulls – Even though their last championship was in 1998, Michael Jordan’s influence keeps the Bulls relevant. The “Jordan effect” means they still have loyal fans decades later.
+ Miami Heat – The LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh "Big Three" era made them a top team to follow. Their tough, no-nonsense playing style under coach Erik Spoelstra continues to attract fans.
+ Boston Celtics – The most successful NBA franchise in terms of total championships (tied with the Lakers). Their mix of history, passionate fanbase, and young stars like Jayson Tatum keeps them in the spotlight.
+ Brooklyn Nets – Once a struggling franchise, they gained serious attention when they stacked their team with superstars like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, and James Harden (even if it didn’t quite work out).
+ Milwaukee Bucks – Giannis Antetokounmpo turned the Bucks into a powerhouse, proving that a small-market team can win championships. Singaporean fans appreciate his work ethic and dominance.
+ Phoenix Suns – The Suns gained a new wave of fans with their recent success, led by Devin Booker and Kevin Durant. Their fast-paced offense makes them an exciting team to watch.
+ Dallas Mavericks – Luka Dončić has made the Mavericks a must-watch team, bringing back memories of Dirk Nowitzki’s legendary run. His flashy style of play keeps fans entertained. Too bad he’s no longer there.
+ Denver Nuggets – The defending champions (thanks to Nikola Jokić) have won over fans with their efficient, unselfish play. Jokić’s unique style as a dominant but humble superstar is a refreshing change.
