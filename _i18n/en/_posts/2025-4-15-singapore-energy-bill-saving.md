In Singapore, where the tropical sun shines relentlessly and the air-conditioning never seems to stop running, finding energy saving tips is practically a national pastime.

Whether you're trying to figure out how to save electricity without sacrificing your comfort or looking for ways to lower those ever-growing electricity bills, the options are endless. Energy-efficient appliances and electricity saving devices have become the modern-day heroes of reducing energy consumption, though they sometimes require more than just a plug-in to do their magic. From embracing solar energy to hopping on board energy conservation programs, Singapore is slowly but surely stepping into the world of sustainable energy—though, if we’re being honest, we all know it's easier said than done. So, let’s explore the best energy-saving practices to get you on the road to a greener (and hopefully cheaper) lifestyle.

### Who supplies electricity in Singapore?

In Singapore, SP Group (Singapore Power Group) is the main provider of electricity transmission and distribution. However, since the electricity market was liberalized, consumers can now choose from a range of retail electricity providers. These include companies like Singtel, iSwitch, Keppel Electric, and Sembcorp Power, among others. Customers can compare prices and plans to find the best deal for their needs, but the SP Group still manages the overall infrastructure, ensuring a stable supply of electricity across the island.

### How do you choose between retail electricity providers in Singapore?

Choosing between retail electricity providers in Singapore involves comparing several factors to find the best deal for your needs. Here's how to go about it:

+ Pricing Plans: Retailers offer various plans, such as fixed-price plans, where the rate stays the same for a set period, or floating-price plans, which can fluctuate with market conditions. Consider which one fits your budget and risk tolerance better.
+ Contract Terms: Look at the contract duration and any early termination fees. Some plans might offer shorter terms, while others lock you in for a longer period with penalties for breaking the contract early.
+ Discounts and Promotions: Retailers often have special discounts or sign-up promotions. Check whether there are any cash rebates, free gifts, or other incentives that can make your choice more affordable.
+ Customer Service and Reviews: Research each provider's customer service quality. It helps to read reviews or ask for recommendations to ensure you'll get good support if you face any issues.
+ Green Energy Options: If you're looking to go eco-friendly, some providers offer plans that source their electricity from renewable sources, like solar energy. This is worth considering if sustainability is important to you.
+ Additional Features: Some providers offer energy management tools or smart apps to track usage and help you manage your electricity consumption better.

The Energy Market Authority (EMA) also has a comparison tool called Power@Home that lets you easily compare the rates and plans from different retail electricity providers.

### How much is the average electricity bill per household for Singapore?

The average electricity bill for a household in Singapore typically ranges between $100 and $200 per month, depending on factors like the size of the home, number of occupants, and usage habits.

For a typical 3-room HDB flat, the average electricity bill is around $80 to $120 per month. For a 5-room HDB flat or larger private homes, the bill can range between $150 to $250 or more, depending on factors like air conditioning usage, appliance types, and overall energy consumption.

Several factors influence the electricity bill:

+ Air conditioning usage: Air conditioning can account for a significant portion of the bill, especially if used frequently.
+ Appliance efficiency: Using energy-efficient appliances can help lower your costs.
+ Lifestyle habits: How often you leave lights on, run appliances, and whether you use electricity-saving tips all play a role.

For those aiming to reduce their bills, employing energy-saving practices like switching to energy-efficient appliances, utilizing smart thermostats, and taking advantage of solar energy (where possible) can help lower monthly costs.

### Why is electricity so expensive in Singapore?

Electricity in Singapore can seem expensive for several reasons, though the main factors boil down to its energy market structure, reliance on imported fuel, and global energy trends:

+ Dependence on Imported Fuel: Singapore doesn’t have its own natural resources like oil or gas, so it relies heavily on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) for power generation. The cost of LNG can fluctuate with global energy prices, which means higher bills when global fuel prices rise.
+ Global Energy Price Trends: The global energy market, especially oil and gas prices, impacts electricity prices in Singapore. Any increase in global energy costs, often driven by geopolitical tensions or supply chain disruptions, can lead to higher electricity costs locally.
+ Energy Market Liberalization: While consumers can choose between retail electricity providers, the wholesale market sets the base price, which is influenced by international fuel costs and demand. This makes the prices less predictable and subject to market volatility.
+ Infrastructure and Maintenance Costs: Singapore invests heavily in maintaining its power infrastructure, including the electricity grid and ensuring a reliable supply. These costs are reflected in your monthly bill.
+ Environmental Policies: Singapore is pushing for sustainability through green energy initiatives, like investing in solar energy and energy-efficient technologies. While these efforts help the environment in the long run, they can increase costs in the short term as infrastructure and technology upgrades take place.

So while it may feel like Singaporeans are paying the price for having a strong, reliable, and sustainable power supply, unfortunately, it’s also due to the global energy landscape and a lack of local natural resources.

### What subsidies have the government provided to reduce electricity prices?

The Singapore government has provided several subsidies and initiatives to help reduce electricity prices and alleviate the financial burden on households, especially during times of rising energy costs. Here are some key programs:

+ Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG):
Provides financial support to businesses and households for adopting energy-efficient equipment or solutions. This helps reduce overall electricity consumption, lowering bills over time.

+ Temporary Electricity Relief Scheme (TERS):
Launched during periods of high electricity prices (like during the COVID-19 pandemic), this scheme provides cash payouts or electricity credits to households and businesses to cushion the impact of rising energy costs.

+ U-Save Rebates:
Part of the GST Voucher Scheme, this provides utilities rebates (including electricity) to eligible lower- and middle-income households living in public housing (HDB flats). The rebates help reduce monthly utility bills.

+ Pioneer Generation Package:
Offers utilities rebates to seniors born on or before 31 December 1949, helping reduce electricity and water bills as part of the broader Pioneer Generation Package.

+ Public Utilities (Electricity) Price Subsidies:
The government sometimes provides direct subsidies to reduce the impact of higher electricity tariffs for eligible groups, such as low-income families and seniors.

+ SolarNova Program:
Encourages the installation of solar panels on residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The government provides financial support for solar adoption, which can help reduce long-term electricity costs.

+ Smart Energy Management Programs:
Various programs to encourage consumers to use energy-efficient appliances and adopt smart energy management systems, lowering electricity consumption.

### Tips to reducing your electricity bill

+ Chill Out, Not the AC!
Try setting your air conditioner’s temperature at 25°C or higher. You’ll be surprised at how much energy (and money) you’ll save by not treating your home like an icebox.

+ Switch to Energy-Efficient Appliances
Invest in energy-efficient appliances (look for the Energy Star label). They might cost a little more upfront, but they’ll save you big in the long run.

+ The Power of the Power Strip
Unplug your devices when you're not using them, or use a power strip to turn off multiple electronics with a single switch. Phantom power is sneaky and adds up over time!

+ Solar Power, Baby!
If you can, go solar! Consider installing solar panels through government schemes like SolarNova. It might not cut your bill immediately, but it'll certainly be a long-term game-changer.

+ Use the Microwave, Not the Oven
When cooking, microwaves use less energy than traditional ovens. Plus, you won’t need to heat up the whole house in the process!

+ Bright Ideas: Switch to LED Bulbs
If you haven’t already, switch all your lights to LED bulbs. They use 90% less energy and last much longer than regular bulbs.

+ Laundry Room Energy Hack
Only do laundry with a full load and try washing with cold water. Line-dry your clothes when you can to save on the dryer bill.

+ Fan-tastic Cooling Solution
If you must use fans, set them at higher speeds or use a ceiling fan. Ceiling fans cool a room more effectively than table fans and use way less energy.

+ Smart Energy Management
Use a smart thermostat or energy management app to monitor your electricity usage in real-time. If you know how much you’re using, you’re more likely to make better decisions.

+ Don’t Let the Dishwasher Run Half-Empty
Run your dishwasher only when it's full to maximize energy efficiency. And consider using the eco-mode if your machine has one.

+ Get Cozy with Natural Light
Open those blinds! Take advantage of daylight during the day rather than relying on artificial lighting. It’s good for your energy bill and your mood.

+ Turn It Off, Seriously
If you're not in the room, turn off the lights. Even your TV and computer can be switched off when you're not using them to avoid unnecessary energy consumption.

### What initiatives have corporations and shopping malls done to save energy in Singapore?

+ Green Building Certifications: Many malls and corporations have achieved BCA Green Mark certification, implementing energy-efficient systems like LED lighting, smart HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and better insulation.

+ Solar Panel Installations: Malls like VivoCity and corporations such as Singtel have installed solar panels on rooftops to harness solar energy for lighting and cooling, reducing reliance on grid electricity.

+ Energy Management Systems: Companies like CapitaLand and Frasers Property use smart energy management systems to monitor and optimize energy consumption across their buildings in real-time. That’s why some restaurants dim their lights at night too!

+ Use of Energy-Efficient Appliances: Many shopping malls and corporate offices have switched to energy-efficient appliances like LED lights, eco-friendly escalators, and energy-saving air conditioners to reduce consumption.

+ Green Retail Practices: Malls such as ION Orchard have adopted energy-efficient escalators and automated lighting systems, ensuring energy is used only when necessary.
