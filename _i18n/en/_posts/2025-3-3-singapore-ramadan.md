Ramadan 2025 in Singapore is more than just a month of fasting—it’s a time of spiritual reflection, community gatherings, and, of course, legendary iftar buffets and Ramadan bazaars.

From sunrise to sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and, yes, even that morning coffee, while the rest of Singapore tiptoes around their fasting colleagues. But before Ramadan even begins, there’s a whole list of things not to do—think indulgent feasting and last-minute guilt trips to repent for the year’s snacks. Once it starts, expect bustling mosques, late-night prayers, and the city’s most vibrant food markets popping up in Geylang Serai and beyond. Whether you're looking for the best places to break your fast or just wondering what makes Ramadan in Singapore so special, here’s everything you need to know.

### What is Ramadan?

Ramadan is the holiest month in Islam, observed by Muslims worldwide through fasting, prayer, and reflection. From sunrise to sunset, those fasting abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs as a way of strengthening their faith and practicing self-discipline. It’s not just about skipping lunch—Ramadan is also a time for charity, community, and deep spiritual connection. Nights are filled with special prayers called taraweeh, and once the sun sets, families and friends gather for iftar (the meal to break the fast), often with dates and a feast that almost makes up for the day’s hunger. In Singapore, Ramadan is marked by lively bazaars, packed mosques, and an overall sense of togetherness—plus, a sudden surge in sales of sweet drinks and fried snacks.

### When is Ramadan in Singapore?

Ramadan in Singapore for the year 2025 is expected to begin on Sunday, March 2, and conclude on Tuesday, March 31. These dates may vary slightly depending on the sighting of the moon, which traditionally marks the start and end of the Islamic lunar months. During this period, Muslims in Singapore will observe fasting from dawn (Fajr) until sunset (Maghrib), engaging in increased prayers and reflection. The end of Ramadan is celebrated with Eid al-Fitr, a festive occasion marked by communal prayers, feasting, and the giving of charity.

### What can you not do before Ramadan?

+ Overindulging in food and drinks – Binge-eating like it’s your last meal on earth won’t make fasting any easier.
+ Ignoring missed fasts from the previous year – If you still have qada (missed fasts) to make up, now’s the time—not halfway through Ramadan.
+ Skipping spiritual preparation – Ramadan isn’t just about avoiding food; it’s about self-reflection. Maybe don’t wait until Day 1 to start praying more.
+ Leaving bad habits unchecked – Whether it’s smoking, excessive screen time, or gossiping, breaking habits before Ramadan makes the transition smoother.
+ Not setting realistic Ramadan goals – Planning to read the entire Quran in a month but haven’t touched it all year? Maybe set achievable goals instead.
+ Forgetting to stock up on essentials – Avoid last-minute grocery panic by prepping dates, prayer mats, and whatever snack you’ll be craving at iftar.
+ Ignoring charity opportunities – Ramadan is about giving, so start thinking about zakat and donations early.
Not fixing your sleep schedule – Taraweeh prayers and suhoor will mess up your routine—better to start adjusting now.

In short, don’t wait until Ramadan starts to get into the right mindset. A little preparation goes a long way!

### What can you not do during ramadan?

During Ramadan, there are a few clear don’ts to keep in mind:
+ No eating or drinking from dawn to sunset – Yes, even water.
+ No smoking or chewing gum – Your breath will survive (hopefully).
+ No marital intimacy during fasting hours
+ No swearing, gossiping, or lying – A spiritual cleanse, not just a food one.
+ No skipping prayers – Fasting isn’t just about hunger; prayer is key.

Basically, it’s about self-control—physically, mentally, and spiritually!

### How is Ramadan celebrated in Singapore?

+ Community iftar events – Mosques and organizations host mass iftars, offering free meals to break fast together.
+ Late-night shopping – Many halal eateries and markets extend their hours to cater to those breaking fast late.
+ Volunteer-driven food distributions – Groups distribute free porridge (bubur Ramadan) and food packs to those in need.
+ Increased religious talks and Quran recitations – Mosques organize lectures and recitation sessions for spiritual enrichment.
+ Special Ramadan promotions – Restaurants, malls, and brands roll out festive discounts and Ramadan-exclusive deals.
