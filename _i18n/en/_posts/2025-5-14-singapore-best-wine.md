## How Much Wine Should You Really Drink?

Moderation is key when it comes to enjoying wine. Health experts generally recommend up to **one glass (about 150ml)** per day for women and **up to two glasses** for men. Drinking wine in moderation has been associated with potential benefits, especially red wine, which contains antioxidants like **resveratrol**. However, excessive consumption can lead to health risks including liver issues, dependency, and increased calorie intake. Whether you're sipping a bold Cabernet or a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, it's best to savour it slowly and responsibly — quality over quantity always wins.

## Is Wine Actually Healthy?

Wine — especially red wine — is often praised for its potential health benefits when consumed in moderation. The key compound behind this is **resveratrol**, an antioxidant found in grape skins that may help support heart health.

### 🩺 Potential Benefits
- **Heart Health**: Studies suggest moderate wine drinkers have a **20–30% lower risk of heart disease** compared to non-drinkers (*Harvard School of Public Health*).
- **Antioxidants**: Red wine contains flavonoids and polyphenols that may help reduce inflammation and protect blood vessels.
- **Longevity**: The "Mediterranean diet," which includes moderate wine intake, is linked to **longer life expectancy**.

### ⚠️ Risks of Overconsumption
- Exceeding the recommended limits can increase the risk of:
  - **Liver disease**
  - **Certain cancers**
  - **High blood pressure**
  - **Addiction or alcohol dependency**

### 📏 Recommended Limits
- Women: **1 standard glass (150ml)** per day
- Men: **Up to 2 glasses (300ml)** per day

> ✅ **Tip**: Always balance wine intake with a healthy diet, hydration, and regular checkups. If in doubt, consult your doctor — not your bartender.
