### What is Easter?

Easter is a Christian holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is said to have occurred three days after his crucifixion. It’s the culmination of the Passion of Jesus, marking the end of the Lent season and the beginning of a new life, both spiritually and symbolically. While the religious significance centers around themes of rebirth and redemption, Easter has also become a cultural celebration filled with traditions like egg hunting, feasting, and spending time with family. In Singapore, you’ll find various Easter events, including church services and festive gatherings, but also plenty of "Easter promotions" and "Easter brunches" for those just in it for the long weekend.

### When is Easter 2025?

Easter doesn’t have a fixed date; it falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox, which means it can be anywhere between March 22 and April 25. In 2025, Easter will be celebrated on April 20. So, if you’re planning for "Easter events Singapore" or hoping to snag some last-minute Easter shopping Singapore deals, now’s the time to mark your calendar!
