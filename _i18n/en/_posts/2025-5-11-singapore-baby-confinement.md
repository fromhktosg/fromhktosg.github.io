# What Is Baby Confinement in Singapore?
Baby confinement in Singapore refers to the traditional postnatal practice where new mothers rest and recover for about 28 to 40 days after childbirth.

It’s not just about pampering—it’s believed to help mothers regain strength, prevent long-term health issues, and promote overall well-being.
During confinement, new mums typically receive help from a confinement nanny, enjoy specially prepared confinement food, and follow routines tailored to postnatal recovery. While the specifics may vary by culture, the goal is the same: to support mothers physically and emotionally after giving birth. In Singapore, modern confinement practices blend tradition with convenience, offering everything from meal delivery to full-service confinement centres.
