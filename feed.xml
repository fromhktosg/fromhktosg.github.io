<p>We love talking about the weather. If you enjoy stepping out into clear skies only to be drenched five minutes later, monsoon season in Singapore has got you covered. With the Northeast monsoon bringing months of relentless rain, occasional floods, and that ever-familiar damp sock experience, it’s no wonder people constantly search for the Singapore monsoon forecast or wonder when does it rain in Singapore (hint: all the time). But before you break out the ark, let’s take a look at why the rainy season in Singapore is so persistent, how it impacts daily life, and whether checking the weather in Singapore today actually helps. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-raining-so-much-in-singapore-in-march">Why is it raining so much in Singapore in March?</h3>

<p>If you’re wondering why it’s raining so much in Singapore in March, you’re not alone. March sits at the tail end of the Northeast Monsoon season, which usually lasts from December to early March. During this period, lingering monsoon surges can still bring heavy rain and thunderstorms. Additionally, March marks the transition to the Inter-monsoon season, where warm temperatures and high humidity lead to frequent afternoon showers and even sudden thunderstorms. Combine that with climate change and the usual unpredictability of tropical weather, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for feeling like you live inside a rain cloud. So, if you were hoping for dry, sunny days—well, maybe check back in June.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-will-this-monsoon-rain-last-for">How long will this monsoon rain last for?</h3>

<p>Singapore’s monsoon rain should last about one to two more weeks, with the Northeast Monsoon season ending by mid-March. But don’t ditch the umbrella yet—Inter-monsoon season kicks in right after, bringing unpredictable downpours.</p>

<p>Whether you’re hunting for F1 Singapore tickets, curious about the Singapore GP schedule, or wondering what exactly happens at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, there’s plenty to know. Add in some iconic teams battling for glory, overpriced hotels, and a headliner concert that may or may not be worth the hype — and you’ve got yourself quite the weekend. Don’t forget the post-race excitement when fans eagerly check the Singapore Grand Prix results or relive the action with an F1 Singapore live stream. And if you’re after tips for scoring those pricey F1 Singapore qualifying tickets without maxing out your credit card — I’ve got you covered.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-f1">What is F1?</h3>

<p>Formula 1 (F1) is the pinnacle of motorsport — a high-speed, high-stakes competition where the world’s best drivers push multi-million-dollar cars to their absolute limit. Think of it as the Olympics of racing, but with way more tire changes and fewer gold medals. Each season features a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held on circuits across the globe. The teams? They’re engineering powerhouses like Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari, constantly battling for bragging rights and championship points. In short, F1 is fast, flashy, and fiercely competitive — perfect for those who love speed or just want an excuse to sip champagne trackside.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-f1-circuit-work">How does the F1 circuit work?</h3>

<p>The F1 circuit isn’t just about drivers flooring it and hoping for the best — there’s a method to the madness. Each season has a set number of Grands Prix races held in different countries, forming the F1 calendar. Drivers and teams earn points based on their race positions, with the ultimate goal of winning either the Drivers’ Championship (for the fastest human) or the Constructors’ Championship (for the team that nailed both speed and strategy). Races are held on a mix of purpose-built tracks and challenging street circuits — like Singapore’s iconic Marina Bay Street Circuit. Oh, and there’s qualifying too — a three-part session where drivers fight for the best starting position, because nobody wants to start the race staring at everyone else’s exhaust.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-f1-race-tracks-globally">What are the F1 race tracks globally?</h3>

<p>F1 race tracks span the globe, from iconic circuits with decades of history to modern marvels designed for pure speed. You’ve got legendary tracks like Monza in Italy, known as the “Temple of Speed,” and the twisty streets of Monaco, where millionaires park their yachts just to watch cars squeeze through hairpin turns. Over in Japan, Suzuka keeps drivers on their toes with its infamous figure-eight layout, while Silverstone in the UK is the birthplace of F1 itself. And let’s not forget Singapore’s very own Marina Bay Street Circuit, where drivers race under dazzling lights in one of the most intense night races on the calendar. Whether it’s speed, strategy, or scenery, F1 tracks have a bit of everything—and a whole lot of tire smoke.</p>

<p>The F1 Singapore race track, better known as the Marina Bay Street Circuit, is no ordinary loop of tarmac — it’s a brutal test of endurance disguised as a dazzling night race. With 23 tight corners, limited overtaking spots, and unforgiving walls just centimeters from the racing line, there’s little room for error. The sweltering Singapore humidity makes things even tougher, pushing drivers to their physical limits — some have reported losing up to 3 kg of body weight in sweat during the race. Add in the race’s tendency to run close to the two-hour limit, and it’s no surprise that Singapore is considered one of the most mentally and physically demanding races on the calendar. Survive this one, and you’ve definitely earned that post-race champagne.</p>

  <li>Weekend (Standard 2D): ~$13 to $15</li>
  <li>IMAX or Premium Screens: ~$20 to $25</li>
  <li>Gold Class or VIP Experience: ~$30 to $40+</li>
  <li>Student/Senior Deals: Often ~$7 to $9 (weekdays before 6 PM)</li>
</ul>

<p>Promotions, bundle deals, and loyalty programs can sometimes cut costs, so it’s worth keeping an eye out. And yes, those fancy recliner seats may cost more — but at least you’ll feel like royalty while dramatically overpaying for popcorn.</p>

<h3 id="how-often-do-cinemas-in-singapore-refresh-their-movies">How often do cinemas in Singapore refresh their movies?</h3>

<p>Cinemas in Singapore typically refresh their movie lineup every Thursday. This is when new blockbuster releases, indie films, and even some international titles make their debut. Major chains like Golden Village, Shaw Theatres, and Cathay Cineplexes follow this weekly schedule closely.</p>

<p>That said, big-ticket films (think Marvel or major holiday releases) may occasionally drop on Wednesdays to build early buzz. Meanwhile, smaller indie cinemas like The Projector may switch up their schedule depending on special events or themed screenings.</p>

<p>So if you’re wondering when that shiny new movie lands — Thursday’s your magic day.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-cinemas-in-singapore-make-money">How do cinemas in Singapore make money?</h3>

<p>Cinemas in Singapore don’t just rely on ticket sales — they’ve mastered the art of turning your movie night into a mini spending spree. Here’s how they cash in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ticket Sales – While a chunk goes back to film distributors, cinemas still take a cut — especially from premium formats like IMAX or Gold Class.</li>
  <li>Concession Stands – That $10 popcorn combo? Pure profit. Snacks are where cinemas really clean up.</li>
  <li>Advertising – Those endless pre-movie ads aren’t just for your boredom; brands pay top dollar to show them.</li>
  <li>Event Screenings &amp; Private Bookings – From birthday parties to corporate events, cinemas make bank renting out their halls.</li>
  <li>Loyalty Programs &amp; Memberships – Perks like discounts and free tickets keep moviegoers coming back (and spending more).</li>
  <li>Merchandise &amp; Tie-ins – Some cinemas sell limited-edition collectibles or themed snacks during major film releases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, cinemas are experts at getting you to spend — and somehow convincing you that $6 nachos are totally reasonable.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-cinemas-in-singapore-struggling">Why are cinemas in Singapore struggling?</h3>

<p>Cinemas in Singapore have been grappling with several challenges in recent years, leading to notable closures and financial strains. Key factors contributing to their struggles include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>COVID-19 Pandemic: The pandemic led to prolonged closures and capacity restrictions, significantly reducing revenue. For instance, Cathay Cineplexes faced months-long shutdowns in 2020, followed by operations at reduced capacities.</li>
  <li>Shifts in Consumer Behavior: The rise of streaming platforms has altered viewing habits, with many opting to watch movies at home. This shift has impacted traditional cinema attendance.</li>
  <li>Operational Costs and Rental Pressures: High operational expenses, including rental costs, have strained profitability. In January 2025, Cathay Cineplexes received letters of demand for approximately S$2.7 million in unpaid rent and related costs for its operations at Century Square and Causeway Point.</li>
</ul>

<p>These challenges have led to several cinema closures in Singapore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Cathay Cineplex (Handy Road): Ceased operations on June 26, 2022, ending 83 years of cinematic history at the site.</li>
  <li>Cathay Cineleisure Orchard: Closed on June 30, 2023. Subsequently, a collaboration between Golden Village and The Projector took over the cinema space.</li>
  <li>Cathay Cineplex at Parkway Parade: Shut down on August 27, 2023, as part of efforts to “right-size” operations.</li>
  <li>Cathay Cineplex at AMK Hub: Closed after June 30, 2024, with the space slated for repurposing for civic and community uses.</li>
  <li>Cathay Cineplex at West Mall: Ceased operations on February 20, 2025, due to lease expiry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these setbacks, cinema operators are exploring strategies such as mergers and diversifying offerings to adapt to the evolving entertainment landscape and sustain their presence in Singapore.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-cinemas-in-singapore-adapting-to-attract-more-customers">How are cinemas in Singapore adapting to attract more customers?</h3>

<p>Cinemas in Singapore have been getting creative to lure audiences back. Here’s how they’re adapting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Luxury Experiences – Cinemas like Golden Village Gold Class and Shaw Theatres Lumiere offer plush recliners, gourmet dining, and even blankets to elevate your movie night.</li>
  <li>Themed Screenings &amp; Events – The Projector regularly hosts nostalgic movie marathons, cult classic nights, and themed parties that feel more like social events than traditional screenings.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Tech &amp; Screens – IMAX, Dolby Atmos, and 4DX experiences are being pushed hard to remind viewers that their home TV just isn’t the same.</li>
  <li>Food Upgrades – Some cinemas are going beyond popcorn, offering restaurant-quality meals, bubble tea, and even cocktails.</li>
  <li>Loyalty Perks &amp; Memberships – Chains like GV Movie Club and Shaw Theatres’ membership programs offer discounts, free tickets, and priority bookings to keep regulars coming back.</li>
  <li>Alternative Content – Cinemas are screening live sports, concerts, and even gaming events to broaden their audience base.</li>
  <li>Private Screenings &amp; Rentals – For those who prefer a more exclusive experience, some cinemas now allow you to book entire halls for parties or private viewings.</li>
</ul>

<p>From cozy blankets to bubble tea with your blockbuster, Singapore’s cinemas are doing their best to make sure you leave your couch once in a while.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-projector-and-what-makes-it-special">What is ‘The Projector’ and what makes it special?</h3>

<p>The Projector is Singapore’s indie cinema gem — a far cry from your typical mall movie theater. Known for its retro vibe and eclectic lineup, The Projector screens everything from arthouse films and cult classics to international indie hits and local productions.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-the-projector-special">What makes The Projector special?</h3>

  <li>Themed Events &amp; Parties – From drag shows to karaoke nights and themed movie screenings, The Projector doubles as a lively social space.</li>

<p>Whether you’re checking NBA scores, keeping up with NBA standings, or planning your week around the NBA schedule, there’s no shortage of ways to stay updated.

From catching the latest NBA news to searching for an NBA live stream at odd hours, Singaporeans have found ways to stay connected to the game. And if all that isn’t enough, there are even local courts where you can attempt your own version of an NBA highlight—just with a little less dunking.</p>

<h3 id="is-basketball-popular-in-singapore">Is basketball popular in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Basketball has a decent following in Singapore, especially with the NBA’s global appeal. While it’s not as big as football, local courts stay busy, and big NBA events like the NBA Playoffs and NBA Finals always draw attention.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-singaporeans-like-watching-basketball--watching-the-nba">Why do Singaporeans like watching basketball / watching the NBA?</h3>

  <li>Chicago Bulls – Even though their last championship was in 1998, Michael Jordan’s influence keeps the Bulls relevant. The “Jordan effect” means they still have loyal fans decades later.</li>

If you’ve ever stepped outside and felt like you were swimming through the air, you’re not alone.</p>

But how does Singapore’s climate compare to other hot countries, and is there a risk of temperatures going even higher in the future? Before you start planning a personal air-conditioning bubble, we’ll explore why Singapore is so humid, how hot it gets across different months, and some crazy ideas to keep the country cool.

<p>So, whether it’s January or June, Singapore’s heat is relentless—but at least there’s air-conditioning everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-singapore-so-hot">Why is Singapore so hot?</h3>

<p>Singapore is so hot because it sits almost directly on the equator, meaning the sun is practically overhead all year long. Unlike places with four seasons, Singapore doesn’t get a break—no winter, no cool autumn breeze, just endless summer. The country’s high humidity (often above 80%) makes it feel even hotter, trapping heat like a sticky, invisible blanket. Plus, urbanization and the heat island effect from all the concrete and buildings make things worse, keeping the city warm even at night. And if you’re hoping for a sudden cold spell—sorry, the only ice you’ll find is in your bubble tea.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-singapore-not-have-seasons">Why does Singapore not have seasons?</h3>

<p>Same reasons as above. Singapore doesn’t have seasons because it’s located near the equator, where the sun’s position and temperature stay consistent year-round.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-singapores-temperatures-rank-versus-other-hot-countries">How does Singapore’s temperatures rank versus other hot countries?</h3>

<p>Singapore is consistently hot, but it’s not the hottest place on Earth. Compared to desert regions like Death Valley, USA (up to 56.7°C) or Kuwait (over 50°C in summer), Singapore’s 34°C max might seem mild. However, what makes Singapore unbearable is the humidity, which pushes the heat index (feels-like temperature) past 40°C. Among tropical cities, Singapore ranks alongside Jakarta, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur, but its urban heat island effect makes it feel hotter than many of them, especially at night. So while you won’t fry an egg on the pavement, you’ll definitely sweat through your shirt in minutes.</p>

<h3 id="tips-to-stay-cool-in-the-heat">Tips to stay cool in the heat</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wear light, breathable clothing – Stick to loose, moisture-wicking fabrics like cotton or linen to stay comfortable.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated – Drink plenty of water (or iced kopi, no judgment) to prevent dehydration and overheating.</li>
  <li>Seek air-conditioning – Malls, MRT stations, and underground walkways are your best friends in Singapore’s heat.</li>
  <li>Avoid the midday sun – The sun is strongest between 11 AM – 3 PM, so plan outdoor activities in the morning or evening.</li>
  <li>Use cooling products – Carry a portable fan, cooling wipes, or even a mist spray to survive Singapore’s never-ending sauna.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-weather/">previous article</a> to learn more about these tips and tricks.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-risk-of-temperatures-going-higher-in-the-future-in-singapore">Is there a risk of temperatures going higher in the future in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Singapore’s temperatures are expected to rise due to climate change and urbanization. Global warming is pushing up temperatures worldwide, and Singapore’s urban heat island effect (all that concrete trapping heat) makes it worse. The government projects that by 2100, average temperatures could rise by 4°C, meaning 35°C+ days could become the norm. Increased humidity will also make the “feels-like” temperature even more unbearable. So yes, it’s already hot—but the future might be even hotter.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-cause-higher-temperatures-in-singapore">What would cause higher temperatures in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Higher temperatures in Singapore would be caused by a mix of climate change and urbanization. Global warming is driving up temperatures worldwide, leading to more extreme heat. The urban heat island effect—where concrete, glass, and asphalt trap and radiate heat—makes Singapore even warmer, especially at night. Deforestation in and around the region also reduces natural cooling, while increasing carbon emissions from industries and transport worsen the problem. And if that’s not enough, rising sea levels could lead to more humid conditions, making the heat feel even more unbearable.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-singapore-best-adapt-for-higher-temperatures">How can Singapore best adapt for higher temperatures?</h3>

<ul>

<h3 id="crazy-ideas-to-keep-singapore-cool">Crazy ideas to keep Singapore cool</h3>

<p>Here are some crazy (but maybe genius) ideas to keep Singapore cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Giant air-conditioned domes – Just cover the whole city like Gardens by the Bay and blast the AC. Problem solved.</li>
  <li>Floating icebergs in Marina Bay – Tug some ice from Antarctica and let it melt slowly for a natural cooling effect.</li>
  <li>Underground Singapore 2.0 – Build an entire underground city where it’s always cool, and never step outside again.</li>
  <li>Massive misting systems – Turn every lamppost into a fine mist sprayer so stepping outside feels like walking through a cooling cloud.</li>
  <li>Heat-reflecting skyscrapers – Cover buildings in reflective materials to bounce heat away—bonus if they double as giant solar panels.</li>
  <li>Artificial rain-on-demand – Control the clouds and make it rain whenever temperatures hit unbearable levels.</li>
  <li>Citywide ice baths – Free public ice baths at MRT stations—because desperate times call for refreshing measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these may sound ridiculous, but hey, Singapore already air-conditions its bus stops, so anything is possible!</p>

<p>From sunrise to sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and, yes, even that morning coffee, while the rest of Singapore tiptoes around their fasting colleagues. But before Ramadan even begins, there’s a whole list of things not to do—think indulgent feasting and last-minute guilt trips to repent for the year’s snacks. Once it starts, expect bustling mosques, late-night prayers, and the city’s most vibrant food markets popping up in Geylang Serai and beyond. Whether you’re looking for the best places to break your fast or just wondering what makes Ramadan in Singapore so special, here’s everything you need to know.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ramadan">What is Ramadan?</h3>

<p>Ramadan is the holiest month in Islam, observed by Muslims worldwide through fasting, prayer, and reflection. From sunrise to sunset, those fasting abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs as a way of strengthening their faith and practicing self-discipline. It’s not just about skipping lunch—Ramadan is also a time for charity, community, and deep spiritual connection. Nights are filled with special prayers called taraweeh, and once the sun sets, families and friends gather for iftar (the meal to break the fast), often with dates and a feast that almost makes up for the day’s hunger. In Singapore, Ramadan is marked by lively bazaars, packed mosques, and an overall sense of togetherness—plus, a sudden surge in sales of sweet drinks and fried snacks.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-ramadan-in-singapore">When is Ramadan in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Ramadan in Singapore for the year 2025 is expected to begin on Sunday, March 2, and conclude on Tuesday, March 31. These dates may vary slightly depending on the sighting of the moon, which traditionally marks the start and end of the Islamic lunar months. During this period, Muslims in Singapore will observe fasting from dawn (Fajr) until sunset (Maghrib), engaging in increased prayers and reflection. The end of Ramadan is celebrated with Eid al-Fitr, a festive occasion marked by communal prayers, feasting, and the giving of charity.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-not-do-before-ramadan">What can you not do before Ramadan?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Overindulging in food and drinks – Binge-eating like it’s your last meal on earth won’t make fasting any easier.</li>
  <li>Ignoring missed fasts from the previous year – If you still have qada (missed fasts) to make up, now’s the time—not halfway through Ramadan.</li>
  <li>Skipping spiritual preparation – Ramadan isn’t just about avoiding food; it’s about self-reflection. Maybe don’t wait until Day 1 to start praying more.</li>
  <li>Leaving bad habits unchecked – Whether it’s smoking, excessive screen time, or gossiping, breaking habits before Ramadan makes the transition smoother.</li>
  <li>Not setting realistic Ramadan goals – Planning to read the entire Quran in a month but haven’t touched it all year? Maybe set achievable goals instead.</li>
  <li>Forgetting to stock up on essentials – Avoid last-minute grocery panic by prepping dates, prayer mats, and whatever snack you’ll be craving at iftar.</li>
  <li>Ignoring charity opportunities – Ramadan is about giving, so start thinking about zakat and donations early.
Not fixing your sleep schedule – Taraweeh prayers and suhoor will mess up your routine—better to start adjusting now.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, don’t wait until Ramadan starts to get into the right mindset. A little preparation goes a long way!</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-not-do-during-ramadan">What can you not do during ramadan?</h3>

<p>During Ramadan, there are a few clear don’ts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No eating or drinking from dawn to sunset – Yes, even water.</li>
  <li>No smoking or chewing gum – Your breath will survive (hopefully).</li>
  <li>No marital intimacy during fasting hours</li>
  <li>No swearing, gossiping, or lying – A spiritual cleanse, not just a food one.</li>
  <li>No skipping prayers – Fasting isn’t just about hunger; prayer is key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, it’s about self-control—physically, mentally, and spiritually!</p>

<h3 id="how-is-ramadan-celebrated-in-singapore">How is Ramadan celebrated in Singapore?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Community iftar events – Mosques and organizations host mass iftars, offering free meals to break fast together.</li>

<p>So, why do people like cricket? Maybe it’s the excitement of the SPL fixtures or just a great way to escape the heat while playing at places like the Kallang Cricket Ground or West Coast Park. As for which nationalities are most into cricket in Singapore—well, you’d be surprised that the Indian community leads the charge, with a few other cricket-loving nations not too far behind. If you’re wondering whether there are cricket leagues or even classes in Singapore, the answer is yes, of course—just check out local forums for leagues like the Singapore Cricket League (SCL) or cricket academies like the Cricket Coaching Academy.

<h3 id="what-is-cricket">What is cricket?</h3>

<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport, often considered the second most popular game in the world (behind football, of course). Played between two teams of 11 players each, the objective is for one team to score as many runs as possible while the other team tries to dismiss them—sounds simple, right? The game is typically played on an oval-shaped field with a pitch in the center, where the action happens. Players use a bat to hit a ball, while bowlers (yes, they’re not called pitchers here) try to get them out in various entertaining ways. Whether you’re watching the SPL or the IPL, cricket is all about strategy, teamwork, and, for some reason, a lot of tea breaks. Cricket originated in England in the 16th century, evolving from a simple rural game into the globally followed sport we know today.</p>

In Singapore, you’ll find various Easter events, including church services and festive gatherings, but also plenty of “Easter promotions” and “Easter brunches” for those just in it for the long weekend.</p>

<p>But why does Singapore see heavy rain so often, and what exactly are flash floods? Keeping an eye on flash flood warnings Singapore and PUB flood alerts can save you from an unexpected soak, especially in Singapore flood-prone areas that seem to flood at the first sign of a drizzle. Knowing the top flash flood locations in Singapore is just as crucial as knowing what to do during flash floods if you are in your car or on the road—because no one enjoys being stranded in rising waters. And while Singapore flood prevention measures are in place, you might still want to look into how to insure yourself from flash flood damages—because even the best drainage systems can’t fight the wrath of a proper monsoon. Let’s dive in</p>

<h3 id="why-does-singapore-see-heavy-rain">Why does Singapore see heavy rain?</h3>

<p>Singapore sees heavy rain due to its tropical climate, which brings high humidity, warm temperatures, and frequent thunderstorms. Being near the equator, Singapore experiences monsoon seasons, particularly the Northeast Monsoon (December to March) and the Southwest Monsoon (June to September), both of which contribute to intense rainfall. Additionally, Sumatra squalls—fast-moving thunderstorms from Indonesia—can bring sudden, heavy downpours, especially in the morning. Urbanization also plays a role, as the urban heat island effect can lead to increased cloud formation and localized heavy rain. So, while Singapore’s weather may seem unpredictable, the science behind its frequent rain showers is anything but.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-flash-floods">What are flash floods?</h3>

<p>Flash floods are sudden, intense floods that occur within a short period after heavy rainfall, often overwhelming drainage systems and turning roads into rivers. In Singapore, these floods happen when heavy rain falls faster than the water can drain away, especially in flood-prone areas with poor natural absorption, like urban streets and low-lying roads. Unlike regular floods, flash floods develop rapidly and recede quickly, sometimes lasting only minutes but causing significant disruption. They are often triggered by intense thunderstorms, monsoon rains, or Sumatra squalls.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-track-flash-floods-in-singapore">How to track flash floods in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Tracking flash floods in Singapore is easier than ever, thanks to real-time updates from various sources. The PUB flood alerts system provides live flood monitoring through the PUB website and social media channels. You can also check the NEA’s myENV app, which offers flash flood warnings Singapore along with weather forecasts and rainfall intensity maps. For live traffic updates, the LTA’s OneMotoring website and Google Maps can help you spot affected roads and avoid getting stuck in Singapore flood-prone areas. If you prefer a more traditional approach, just look outside—if your street resembles a river, it’s probably time to stay indoors.</p>

<h3 id="top-flash-flood-locations-in-singapore">Top flash flood locations in Singapore</h3>

<p>Here are some top flash flood locations in Singapore, known for frequent waterlogging during heavy rain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bukit Timah Road &amp; Dunearn Road – A long-time flood hotspot despite drainage upgrades.</li>
  <li>Upper Thomson Road – Prone to flooding near low-lying areas and construction zones.</li>
  <li>Tanjong Katong Road &amp; Mountbatten Road – Coastal proximity and aging drainage make this area vulnerable.</li>
  <li>Pasir Panjang Road – Often affected due to its low-lying terrain.</li>
  <li>Paya Lebar &amp; Geylang – Frequent flash floods, especially near industrial areas.</li>
  <li>Newton Circus – A busy intersection that quickly floods after heavy rain.</li>
  <li>Serangoon Road – Water accumulation happens fast in certain stretches.</li>
  <li>Jalan Boon Lay – Flood-prone due to its location near drainage channels.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-do-during-flash-floods-if-you-are-in-your-car">What to do during flash floods if you are in your car?</h3>

<p>If you’re caught in a flash flood while driving, here’s what to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stay calm and assess the situation – Panicking won’t help; check how deep the water is before proceeding.</li>
  <li>Avoid driving through deep water – If water reaches half your tire height, turn around or find a safer route.</li>
  <li>Drive slowly and steadily – If you must drive through, use low gear to prevent engine stalling.</li>
  <li>Never restart a stalled car – This can damage your engine. Instead, abandon the vehicle if water keeps rising.</li>
  <li>Head to higher ground – If roads ahead are submerged, park somewhere safe and wait it out.</li>
  <li>Turn on hazard lights – This alerts other drivers to your presence.</li>
  <li>Monitor PUB flood alerts &amp; flash flood warnings Singapore – Stay updated via weather and traffic apps.</li>
  <li>Call for assistance if needed – If trapped, contact emergency services (995 or 999) for help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Singapore’s flood prevention measures are good, but nature still wins sometimes—so it’s best to be prepared!</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-during-flash-floods-if-you-are-walking-on-the-street">What to do during flash floods if you are walking on the street?</h3>

<p>If you’re caught in a flash flood while walking on the street, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move to higher ground immediately – Avoid low-lying areas where water accumulates quickly.</li>
  <li>Stay away from drains and canals – Fast-moving water can sweep you off your feet.</li>
  <li>Avoid walking through floodwaters – You can’t see hazards like open drains, potholes, or submerged debris.</li>
  <li>Use sturdy railings for support – If you must wade through water, hold onto something stable.</li>
  <li>Monitor PUB flood alerts &amp; flash flood warnings Singapore – Check for updates to plan a safe route.</li>
  <li>Watch out for traffic – Vehicles may lose control in deep water, increasing accident risks.</li>
  <li>Wear waterproof shoes or go barefoot if necessary – Slippery footwear can be dangerous in strong currents.</li>
  <li>Seek shelter if the rain is heavy – Find a safe, elevated place to wait it out.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-do-if-youre-being-swept-away-by-a-flood">What to do if you’re being swept away by a flood?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re being swept away by a flood, here’s what to do:</li>
  <li>Don’t fight the current – Conserve energy and float on your back if possible.</li>
  <li>Look for something to grab onto – Trees, poles, or sturdy structures can help you stay above water.</li>
  <li>Try to move diagonally toward safety – Swim or wade towards the nearest high ground instead of going against the flow.</li>
  <li>Avoid drains and fast-moving water – Getting pulled into a drain or canal is extremely dangerous.</li>
  <li>Shout for help and signal rescuers – Wave your arms or use a loud object to attract attention.</li>
  <li>Stay calm and keep breathing – Panicking can lead to exhaustion and increase the risk of drowning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-insure-yourself-from-flash-food-damages">How to insure yourself from flash food damages?</h3>

<p>To protect yourself from flash flood damages in Singapore, consider these insurance options—though, generally, you don’t need insurance unless you live or work in a flood-prone area.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Home Insurance with Flood Coverage – Ensure your policy includes protection against water damage to your home and belongings.</li>
  <li>Car Insurance with Act of God Coverage – Some comprehensive plans cover vehicle damage from floods, but check the fine print</li>
  <li>Personal Accident Insurance – Provides financial support for injuries caused by unexpected disasters, including flash floods.</li>
  <li>Business Insurance for Flood Damage – If you own a shop or office in a Singapore flood-prone area, get coverage for property loss.</li>
  <li>Document Damage Immediately – Take photos and videos of flood-related losses for smooth insurance claims.</li>
</ul>

<p>While Singapore flood prevention measures are in place, insurance is your financial safety net when nature takes over—but for most people, it’s not a must-have.</p>

  <li>Pay at the counter – Most kopitiams require you to pay at the counter after placing your order. You’ll receive a receipt with a number, which corresponds to your food order.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-a-kopitiam-and-a-food-court">What’s the difference between a Kopitiam and a food court?</h3>

<p>The main differences between a kopitiam and a food court are in their origins, food offerings, and atmosphere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Origins: Kopitiams are traditional, local coffee shops offering simple, nostalgic fare like kaya toast and kopi. Food courts are modern, larger setups in malls with a diverse range of local and international cuisines.</li>
  <li>Food: Kopitiams focus on local breakfast items and comfort food. Food courts offer a variety of dishes from different cuisines, including fast food.</li>
  <li>Atmosphere: Kopitiams are small, intimate, and retro. Food courts are larger, more modern, and often part of commercial complexes.</li>
  <li>Ownership: Kopitiams are often family-run, while food courts are managed by larger operators or corporations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, though, these two are merging together, and there’s not much of a difference at times.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-order-at-kopitiams">What to order at Kopitiams?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Toast &amp; Coffee – Kaya toast with soft-boiled eggs and a cup of local kopi or teh typically costs around $2.50 to $5.</li>
  <li>Mixed Rice / Economy Rice – A plate of mixed rice with a variety of dishes generally costs around $3 to $5, depending on the choices.</li>
  <li>Drinks – Kopi, teh, Milo, or other local drinks are usually priced between $1.50 to $2.50.</li>
  <li>Ban Mian – A bowl of ban mian (noodles in broth with vegetables and meat) is typically around $4 to $6.</li>
  <li>Western Grill – Western meals like grilled chicken or fish with sides generally cost around $6 to $15.</li>
  <li>Wonton Noodles – A bowl of wonton noodles with dumplings and char siew is usually priced at $4 to $6.</li>
  <li>Cantonese-Style BBQ Roast Meat Rice – A plate of BBQ roast meat rice (with char siew, roast pork, or duck) costs around $5 to $8.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="are-kopitiams-disappearing">Are kopitiams disappearing?</h3>

<p>While kopitiams are not exactly disappearing, they are facing challenges. With the rise of modern food courts, cafes, and changing consumer habits, traditional kopitiams are slowly being overshadowed in certain areas. Many younger generations prefer the convenience and variety of food courts or trendy cafés. Additionally, the high cost of renting shop spaces has forced some kopitiams to close or relocate.</p>

<p>However, despite these challenges, kopitiams continue to thrive in certain parts of Singapore, especially in residential areas, and there is still a strong nostalgic appeal for locals who appreciate the traditional offerings. They may be evolving or adapting, but for now, they remain an integral part of Singapore’s food culture.</p>

<h3 id="are-kopitiams-getting-more-expensive">Are kopitiams getting more expensive?</h3>

<p>Kopitiams are getting more expensive, though not to the same extent as high-end restaurants. As with most businesses, rising costs of ingredients, labor, and rent have caused prices to gradually increase over the years. Traditional items like kaya toast, kopi, and mixed rice are no longer as affordable as they used to be, with some prices rising by $2-3 or more which are significant increments for the average joe.</p>

<p>While the price hikes are noticeable, kopitiams still offer a more affordable dining option compared to many other types of eateries in Singapore. However, customers are increasingly feeling the pinch, especially when they’re used to paying lower prices for simple, comfort food.</p>

<p>I personally don’t like Kopitiams but might visit once a month.
