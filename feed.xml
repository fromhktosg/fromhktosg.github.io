<p>So, whether it’s January or June, Singapore’s heat is relentless—but at least there’s air-conditioning everywhere.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-singapore-so-hot">Why is Singapore so hot?</h3>

<p>Singapore is so hot because it sits almost directly on the equator, meaning the sun is practically overhead all year long. Unlike places with four seasons, Singapore doesn’t get a break—no winter, no cool autumn breeze, just endless summer. The country’s high humidity (often above 80%) makes it feel even hotter, trapping heat like a sticky, invisible blanket. Plus, urbanization and the heat island effect from all the concrete and buildings make things worse, keeping the city warm even at night. And if you’re hoping for a sudden cold spell—sorry, the only ice you’ll find is in your bubble tea.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-singapore-not-have-seasons">Why does Singapore not have seasons?</h3>

<p>Same reasons as above. Singapore doesn’t have seasons because it’s located near the equator, where the sun’s position and temperature stay consistent year-round.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-singapores-temperatures-rank-versus-other-hot-countries">How does Singapore’s temperatures rank versus other hot countries?</h3>

<p>Singapore is consistently hot, but it’s not the hottest place on Earth. Compared to desert regions like Death Valley, USA (up to 56.7°C) or Kuwait (over 50°C in summer), Singapore’s 34°C max might seem mild. However, what makes Singapore unbearable is the humidity, which pushes the heat index (feels-like temperature) past 40°C. Among tropical cities, Singapore ranks alongside Jakarta, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur, but its urban heat island effect makes it feel hotter than many of them, especially at night. So while you won’t fry an egg on the pavement, you’ll definitely sweat through your shirt in minutes.</p>

<h3 id="tips-to-stay-cool-in-the-heat">Tips to stay cool in the heat</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Wear light, breathable clothing – Stick to loose, moisture-wicking fabrics like cotton or linen to stay comfortable.</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated – Drink plenty of water (or iced kopi, no judgment) to prevent dehydration and overheating.</li>
  <li>Seek air-conditioning – Malls, MRT stations, and underground walkways are your best friends in Singapore’s heat.</li>
  <li>Avoid the midday sun – The sun is strongest between 11 AM – 3 PM, so plan outdoor activities in the morning or evening.</li>
  <li>Use cooling products – Carry a portable fan, cooling wipes, or even a mist spray to survive Singapore’s never-ending sauna.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://fromhktosg.github.io/singapore-weather/">previous article</a> to learn more about these tips and tricks.</p>

<h3 id="is-there-a-risk-of-temperatures-going-higher-in-the-future-in-singapore">Is there a risk of temperatures going higher in the future in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Singapore’s temperatures are expected to rise due to climate change and urbanization. Global warming is pushing up temperatures worldwide, and Singapore’s urban heat island effect (all that concrete trapping heat) makes it worse. The government projects that by 2100, average temperatures could rise by 4°C, meaning 35°C+ days could become the norm. Increased humidity will also make the “feels-like” temperature even more unbearable. So yes, it’s already hot—but the future might be even hotter.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-cause-higher-temperatures-in-singapore">What would cause higher temperatures in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Higher temperatures in Singapore would be caused by a mix of climate change and urbanization. Global warming is driving up temperatures worldwide, leading to more extreme heat. The urban heat island effect—where concrete, glass, and asphalt trap and radiate heat—makes Singapore even warmer, especially at night. Deforestation in and around the region also reduces natural cooling, while increasing carbon emissions from industries and transport worsen the problem. And if that’s not enough, rising sea levels could lead to more humid conditions, making the heat feel even more unbearable.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-singapore-best-adapt-for-higher-temperatures">How can Singapore best adapt for higher temperatures?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Increase green spaces – Plant more trees, create green roofs, and develop more parks to cool the environment.</li>
  <li>Implement cooling infrastructure – Use reflective surfaces, smart water features, and energy-efficient materials in urban design.</li>
  <li>Promote energy-efficient buildings – Encourage sustainable architecture to reduce heat absorption and lower energy consumption.</li>
  <li>Expand public transportation – Reduce car usage and lower emissions through better, more accessible public transit.</li>
  <li>Improve water management – Enhance drainage and flood prevention systems to cope with extreme weather.</li>
  <li>Invest in climate-resilient technologies – Focus on innovations that help mitigate the effects of heat and climate change.</li>
  <li>Educate the public – Raise awareness on sustainable practices and how to adapt to the changing climate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crazy-ideas-to-keep-singapore-cool">Crazy ideas to keep Singapore cool</h3>

<p>Here are some crazy (but maybe genius) ideas to keep Singapore cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Giant air-conditioned domes – Just cover the whole city like Gardens by the Bay and blast the AC. Problem solved.</li>
  <li>Floating icebergs in Marina Bay – Tug some ice from Antarctica and let it melt slowly for a natural cooling effect.</li>
  <li>Underground Singapore 2.0 – Build an entire underground city where it’s always cool, and never step outside again.</li>
  <li>Massive misting systems – Turn every lamppost into a fine mist sprayer so stepping outside feels like walking through a cooling cloud.</li>
  <li>Heat-reflecting skyscrapers – Cover buildings in reflective materials to bounce heat away—bonus if they double as giant solar panels.</li>
  <li>Artificial rain-on-demand – Control the clouds and make it rain whenever temperatures hit unbearable levels.</li>
  <li>Citywide ice baths – Free public ice baths at MRT stations—because desperate times call for refreshing measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these may sound ridiculous, but hey, Singapore already air-conditions its bus stops, so anything is possible!</p>

<p>From sunrise to sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and, yes, even that morning coffee, while the rest of Singapore tiptoes around their fasting colleagues. But before Ramadan even begins, there’s a whole list of things not to do—think indulgent feasting and last-minute guilt trips to repent for the year’s snacks. Once it starts, expect bustling mosques, late-night prayers, and the city’s most vibrant food markets popping up in Geylang Serai and beyond. Whether you’re looking for the best places to break your fast or just wondering what makes Ramadan in Singapore so special, here’s everything you need to know.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ramadan">What is Ramadan?</h3>

<p>Ramadan is the holiest month in Islam, observed by Muslims worldwide through fasting, prayer, and reflection. From sunrise to sunset, those fasting abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs as a way of strengthening their faith and practicing self-discipline. It’s not just about skipping lunch—Ramadan is also a time for charity, community, and deep spiritual connection. Nights are filled with special prayers called taraweeh, and once the sun sets, families and friends gather for iftar (the meal to break the fast), often with dates and a feast that almost makes up for the day’s hunger. In Singapore, Ramadan is marked by lively bazaars, packed mosques, and an overall sense of togetherness—plus, a sudden surge in sales of sweet drinks and fried snacks.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-ramadan-in-singapore">When is Ramadan in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Ramadan in Singapore for the year 2025 is expected to begin on Sunday, March 2, and conclude on Tuesday, March 31. These dates may vary slightly depending on the sighting of the moon, which traditionally marks the start and end of the Islamic lunar months. During this period, Muslims in Singapore will observe fasting from dawn (Fajr) until sunset (Maghrib), engaging in increased prayers and reflection. The end of Ramadan is celebrated with Eid al-Fitr, a festive occasion marked by communal prayers, feasting, and the giving of charity.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-not-do-before-ramadan">What can you not do before Ramadan?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Overindulging in food and drinks – Binge-eating like it’s your last meal on earth won’t make fasting any easier.</li>
  <li>Ignoring missed fasts from the previous year – If you still have qada (missed fasts) to make up, now’s the time—not halfway through Ramadan.</li>
  <li>Skipping spiritual preparation – Ramadan isn’t just about avoiding food; it’s about self-reflection. Maybe don’t wait until Day 1 to start praying more.</li>
  <li>Leaving bad habits unchecked – Whether it’s smoking, excessive screen time, or gossiping, breaking habits before Ramadan makes the transition smoother.</li>
  <li>Not setting realistic Ramadan goals – Planning to read the entire Quran in a month but haven’t touched it all year? Maybe set achievable goals instead.</li>
  <li>Forgetting to stock up on essentials – Avoid last-minute grocery panic by prepping dates, prayer mats, and whatever snack you’ll be craving at iftar.</li>
  <li>Ignoring charity opportunities – Ramadan is about giving, so start thinking about zakat and donations early.
Not fixing your sleep schedule – Taraweeh prayers and suhoor will mess up your routine—better to start adjusting now.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, don’t wait until Ramadan starts to get into the right mindset. A little preparation goes a long way!</p>

<h3 id="what-can-you-not-do-during-ramadan">What can you not do during ramadan?</h3>

<p>During Ramadan, there are a few clear don’ts to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No eating or drinking from dawn to sunset – Yes, even water.</li>
  <li>No smoking or chewing gum – Your breath will survive (hopefully).</li>
  <li>No marital intimacy during fasting hours</li>
  <li>No swearing, gossiping, or lying – A spiritual cleanse, not just a food one.</li>
  <li>No skipping prayers – Fasting isn’t just about hunger; prayer is key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, it’s about self-control—physically, mentally, and spiritually!</p>

<h3 id="how-is-ramadan-celebrated-in-singapore">How is Ramadan celebrated in Singapore?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Community iftar events – Mosques and organizations host mass iftars, offering free meals to break fast together.</li>
  <li>Late-night shopping – Many halal eateries and markets extend their hours to cater to those breaking fast late.</li>
  <li>Volunteer-driven food distributions – Groups distribute free porridge (bubur Ramadan) and food packs to those in need.</li>
  <li>Increased religious talks and Quran recitations – Mosques organize lectures and recitation sessions for spiritual enrichment.</li>
  <li>Special Ramadan promotions – Restaurants, malls, and brands roll out festive discounts and Ramadan-exclusive deals.</li>
  <li>Hari Raya preparation rush – The last few weeks see a shopping frenzy as families buy clothes, decorations, and festive treats for Eid.</li>

<p>So, why do people like cricket? Maybe it’s the excitement of the SPL fixtures or just a great way to escape the heat while playing at places like the Kallang Cricket Ground or West Coast Park. As for which nationalities are most into cricket in Singapore—well, you’d be surprised that the Indian community leads the charge, with a few other cricket-loving nations not too far behind. If you’re wondering whether there are cricket leagues or even classes in Singapore, the answer is yes, of course—just check out local forums for leagues like the Singapore Cricket League (SCL) or cricket academies like the Cricket Coaching Academy. And if you want to take it global, well, cricket leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL) or the Big Bash League are just a few of the big names to know.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-cricket">What is cricket?</h3>

<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport, often considered the second most popular game in the world (behind football, of course). Played between two teams of 11 players each, the objective is for one team to score as many runs as possible while the other team tries to dismiss them—sounds simple, right? The game is typically played on an oval-shaped field with a pitch in the center, where the action happens. Players use a bat to hit a ball, while bowlers (yes, they’re not called pitchers here) try to get them out in various entertaining ways. Whether you’re watching the SPL or the IPL, cricket is all about strategy, teamwork, and, for some reason, a lot of tea breaks. Cricket originated in England in the 16th century, evolving from a simple rural game into the globally followed sport we know today.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-people-in-singapore-like-cricket">Why do people in Singapore like cricket?</h3>

<p>But why does Singapore see heavy rain so often, and what exactly are flash floods? Keeping an eye on flash flood warnings Singapore and PUB flood alerts can save you from an unexpected soak, especially in Singapore flood-prone areas that seem to flood at the first sign of a drizzle. Knowing the top flash flood locations in Singapore is just as crucial as knowing what to do during flash floods if you are in your car or on the road—because no one enjoys being stranded in rising waters. And while Singapore flood prevention measures are in place, you might still want to look into how to insure yourself from flash flood damages—because even the best drainage systems can’t fight the wrath of a proper monsoon. Let’s dive in</p>

<h3 id="why-does-singapore-see-heavy-rain">Why does Singapore see heavy rain?</h3>

<p>Singapore sees heavy rain due to its tropical climate, which brings high humidity, warm temperatures, and frequent thunderstorms. Being near the equator, Singapore experiences monsoon seasons, particularly the Northeast Monsoon (December to March) and the Southwest Monsoon (June to September), both of which contribute to intense rainfall. Additionally, Sumatra squalls—fast-moving thunderstorms from Indonesia—can bring sudden, heavy downpours, especially in the morning. Urbanization also plays a role, as the urban heat island effect can lead to increased cloud formation and localized heavy rain. So, while Singapore’s weather may seem unpredictable, the science behind its frequent rain showers is anything but.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-flash-floods">What are flash floods?</h3>

<p>Flash floods are sudden, intense floods that occur within a short period after heavy rainfall, often overwhelming drainage systems and turning roads into rivers. In Singapore, these floods happen when heavy rain falls faster than the water can drain away, especially in flood-prone areas with poor natural absorption, like urban streets and low-lying roads. Unlike regular floods, flash floods develop rapidly and recede quickly, sometimes lasting only minutes but causing significant disruption. They are often triggered by intense thunderstorms, monsoon rains, or Sumatra squalls.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-track-flash-floods-in-singapore">How to track flash floods in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Tracking flash floods in Singapore is easier than ever, thanks to real-time updates from various sources. The PUB flood alerts system provides live flood monitoring through the PUB website and social media channels. You can also check the NEA’s myENV app, which offers flash flood warnings Singapore along with weather forecasts and rainfall intensity maps. For live traffic updates, the LTA’s OneMotoring website and Google Maps can help you spot affected roads and avoid getting stuck in Singapore flood-prone areas. If you prefer a more traditional approach, just look outside—if your street resembles a river, it’s probably time to stay indoors.</p>

<h3 id="top-flash-flood-locations-in-singapore">Top flash flood locations in Singapore</h3>

<p>Here are some top flash flood locations in Singapore, known for frequent waterlogging during heavy rain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bukit Timah Road &amp; Dunearn Road – A long-time flood hotspot despite drainage upgrades.</li>
  <li>Upper Thomson Road – Prone to flooding near low-lying areas and construction zones.</li>
  <li>Tanjong Katong Road &amp; Mountbatten Road – Coastal proximity and aging drainage make this area vulnerable.</li>
  <li>Pasir Panjang Road – Often affected due to its low-lying terrain.</li>
  <li>Paya Lebar &amp; Geylang – Frequent flash floods, especially near industrial areas.</li>
  <li>Newton Circus – A busy intersection that quickly floods after heavy rain.</li>
  <li>Serangoon Road – Water accumulation happens fast in certain stretches.</li>
  <li>Jalan Boon Lay – Flood-prone due to its location near drainage channels.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-do-during-flash-floods-if-you-are-in-your-car">What to do during flash floods if you are in your car?</h3>

<p>If you’re caught in a flash flood while driving, here’s what to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stay calm and assess the situation – Panicking won’t help; check how deep the water is before proceeding.</li>
  <li>Avoid driving through deep water – If water reaches half your tire height, turn around or find a safer route.</li>
  <li>Drive slowly and steadily – If you must drive through, use low gear to prevent engine stalling.</li>
  <li>Never restart a stalled car – This can damage your engine. Instead, abandon the vehicle if water keeps rising.</li>
  <li>Head to higher ground – If roads ahead are submerged, park somewhere safe and wait it out.</li>
  <li>Turn on hazard lights – This alerts other drivers to your presence.</li>
  <li>Monitor PUB flood alerts &amp; flash flood warnings Singapore – Stay updated via weather and traffic apps.</li>
  <li>Call for assistance if needed – If trapped, contact emergency services (995 or 999) for help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Singapore’s flood prevention measures are good, but nature still wins sometimes—so it’s best to be prepared!</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-during-flash-floods-if-you-are-walking-on-the-street">What to do during flash floods if you are walking on the street?</h3>

<p>If you’re caught in a flash flood while walking on the street, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move to higher ground immediately – Avoid low-lying areas where water accumulates quickly.</li>
  <li>Stay away from drains and canals – Fast-moving water can sweep you off your feet.</li>
  <li>Avoid walking through floodwaters – You can’t see hazards like open drains, potholes, or submerged debris.</li>
  <li>Use sturdy railings for support – If you must wade through water, hold onto something stable.</li>
  <li>Monitor PUB flood alerts &amp; flash flood warnings Singapore – Check for updates to plan a safe route.</li>
  <li>Watch out for traffic – Vehicles may lose control in deep water, increasing accident risks.</li>
  <li>Wear waterproof shoes or go barefoot if necessary – Slippery footwear can be dangerous in strong currents.</li>
  <li>Seek shelter if the rain is heavy – Find a safe, elevated place to wait it out.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-do-if-youre-being-swept-away-by-a-flood">What to do if you’re being swept away by a flood?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re being swept away by a flood, here’s what to do:</li>
  <li>Don’t fight the current – Conserve energy and float on your back if possible.</li>
  <li>Look for something to grab onto – Trees, poles, or sturdy structures can help you stay above water.</li>
  <li>Try to move diagonally toward safety – Swim or wade towards the nearest high ground instead of going against the flow.</li>
  <li>Avoid drains and fast-moving water – Getting pulled into a drain or canal is extremely dangerous.</li>
  <li>Shout for help and signal rescuers – Wave your arms or use a loud object to attract attention.</li>
  <li>Stay calm and keep breathing – Panicking can lead to exhaustion and increase the risk of drowning.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-insure-yourself-from-flash-food-damages">How to insure yourself from flash food damages?</h3>

<p>To protect yourself from flash flood damages in Singapore, consider these insurance options—though, generally, you don’t need insurance unless you live or work in a flood-prone area.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Home Insurance with Flood Coverage – Ensure your policy includes protection against water damage to your home and belongings.</li>
  <li>Car Insurance with Act of God Coverage – Some comprehensive plans cover vehicle damage from floods, but check the fine print</li>
  <li>Personal Accident Insurance – Provides financial support for injuries caused by unexpected disasters, including flash floods.</li>
  <li>Business Insurance for Flood Damage – If you own a shop or office in a Singapore flood-prone area, get coverage for property loss.</li>
  <li>Document Damage Immediately – Take photos and videos of flood-related losses for smooth insurance claims.</li>

<p>If you’re wondering what is kopitiam or why they’re so beloved, you’re not alone. From the history of traditional kopitiams to the rise of kopitiam chains across the island, these places have served as the backdrop to countless breakfast gatherings and casual catch-ups. As we explore must-try kopitiam dishes, the payment methods at these spots, and whether kopitiams are disappearing or just evolving with higher kopitiam prices, it’s clear that these establishments continue to play a pivotal role in Singapore’s culinary scene. So, whether you’re a local or a visitor, join us as we uncover what makes kopitiams so special and whether they’ll remain a staple for years to come.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-kopitiams-and-how-did-they-come-about">What are Kopitiams and how did they come about?</h3>

<p>Kopitiams have become more than just a place to grab a quick bite; they are an integral part of Singapore’s local kopi culture. From the aroma of freshly brewed kopi to the comforting warmth of kaya toast, these establishments offer a slice of Singapore’s heritage in every cup. While many kopitiam chains dominate the scene, there are still plenty of family-run shops that maintain traditional practices, creating a unique mix of options for both locals and tourists. Whether you’re looking for an affordable breakfast or just want to enjoy the experience of eating in a traditional kopitiam, there’s always something special about the charm of these humble coffee shops. As we explore must-try kopitiam dishes and dive into their payment methods, you’ll see why kopitiams continue to be a beloved part of Singapore’s culinary landscape.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-pay-in-kopitiams">How do you pay in Kopitiams?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pay at the counter – Most kopitiams require you to pay at the counter after placing your order. You’ll receive a receipt with a number, which corresponds to your food order.</li>
  <li>Cash payment – Many kopitiams still operate on a cash-only basis, so make sure to have cash on hand before placing your order.</li>
  <li>Card payment – Some kopitiams, especially those in more modern locations, accept credit or debit cards for payment.</li>
  <li>QR Code/Payment Apps – Increasingly, you can pay via mobile payment apps like PayNow, GrabPay, or AliPay, simply by scanning a QR code.</li>
  <li>Order and pay at table – In some kopitiams with a more café-style setup, you may place your order at the table and pay through a digital system or with the waiter when your meal arrives.</li>
  <li>FairPrice App – Certain kopitiam chains like Toast Box and Koufu allow you to order and pay through the FairPrice app. This is particularly convenient for those looking to avoid long lines and streamline their payments with digital wallets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="list-of-top-kopitiams-and-who-runs-them">List of top kopitiams and who runs them</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Toast Box – Run by BreadTalk Group, Toast Box is a popular kopitiam chain known for its traditional kaya toast, kopi, and local breakfast sets.</li>
  <li>Koufu – A major food court operator, Koufu runs kopitiam-style outlets across Singapore, offering a wide range of local and Asian cuisine in a modern setting.</li>
  <li>Killiney Kopitiam – Founded in 1919, Killiney Kopitiam is one of the oldest kopitiam brands in Singapore and is known for its kaya toast, soft-boiled eggs, and local coffee.</li>
  <li>Old Town White Coffee – A Malaysian chain with a strong presence in Singapore, Old Town White Coffee serves local kopi and traditional breakfast items in a more contemporary, café-style setting.</li>

  <li>Food Republic – Operated by FairPrice Group, Food Republic combines the concept of a modern food court with a kopitiam-style dining experience, offering local dishes alongside international options in a contemporary setting.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-a-kopitiam-and-a-food-court">What’s the difference between a Kopitiam and a food court?</h3>

<p>The main differences between a kopitiam and a food court are in their origins, food offerings, and atmosphere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Origins: Kopitiams are traditional, local coffee shops offering simple, nostalgic fare like kaya toast and kopi. Food courts are modern, larger setups in malls with a diverse range of local and international cuisines.</li>
  <li>Food: Kopitiams focus on local breakfast items and comfort food. Food courts offer a variety of dishes from different cuisines, including fast food.</li>
  <li>Atmosphere: Kopitiams are small, intimate, and retro. Food courts are larger, more modern, and often part of commercial complexes.</li>
  <li>Ownership: Kopitiams are often family-run, while food courts are managed by larger operators or corporations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, though, these two are merging together, and there’s not much of a difference at times.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-order-at-kopitiams">What to order at Kopitiams?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Toast &amp; Coffee – Kaya toast with soft-boiled eggs and a cup of local kopi or teh typically costs around $2.50 to $5.</li>
  <li>Mixed Rice / Economy Rice – A plate of mixed rice with a variety of dishes generally costs around $3 to $5, depending on the choices.</li>
  <li>Drinks – Kopi, teh, Milo, or other local drinks are usually priced between $1.50 to $2.50.</li>
  <li>Ban Mian – A bowl of ban mian (noodles in broth with vegetables and meat) is typically around $4 to $6.</li>
  <li>Western Grill – Western meals like grilled chicken or fish with sides generally cost around $6 to $15.</li>
  <li>Wonton Noodles – A bowl of wonton noodles with dumplings and char siew is usually priced at $4 to $6.</li>
  <li>Cantonese-Style BBQ Roast Meat Rice – A plate of BBQ roast meat rice (with char siew, roast pork, or duck) costs around $5 to $8.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="are-kopitiams-disappearing">Are kopitiams disappearing?</h3>

<p>While kopitiams are not exactly disappearing, they are facing challenges. With the rise of modern food courts, cafes, and changing consumer habits, traditional kopitiams are slowly being overshadowed in certain areas. Many younger generations prefer the convenience and variety of food courts or trendy cafés. Additionally, the high cost of renting shop spaces has forced some kopitiams to close or relocate.</p>

<p>However, despite these challenges, kopitiams continue to thrive in certain parts of Singapore, especially in residential areas, and there is still a strong nostalgic appeal for locals who appreciate the traditional offerings. They may be evolving or adapting, but for now, they remain an integral part of Singapore’s food culture.</p>

<h3 id="are-kopitiams-getting-more-expensive">Are kopitiams getting more expensive?</h3>

<p>Kopitiams are getting more expensive, though not to the same extent as high-end restaurants. As with most businesses, rising costs of ingredients, labor, and rent have caused prices to gradually increase over the years. Traditional items like kaya toast, kopi, and mixed rice are no longer as affordable as they used to be, with some prices rising by $2-3 or more which are significant increments for the average joe.</p>

<p>While the price hikes are noticeable, kopitiams still offer a more affordable dining option compared to many other types of eateries in Singapore. However, customers are increasingly feeling the pinch, especially when they’re used to paying lower prices for simple, comfort food.</p>

<p>I personally don’t like Kopitiams but might visit once a month.

<p>Originally from London, Jellycat has taken the world by storm, proving that stuffed toys aren’t just for kids. Adults, too, have fallen for these cuddly companions, whether for stress relief, aesthetic appeal, or just an excuse to collect yet another plushie. From classic Bashful Bunnies to the latest Amuseable Avocado, there’s always a new Jellycat to obsess over. If you’re wondering where to buy Jellycats in Singapore—or even looking for budget-friendly alternatives—we’ve got you covered.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-jellycats">What are jellycats?</h3>

<p>Jellycats are premium plush toys known for their unbelievably soft texture, quirky designs, and high-quality craftsmanship. They come in a variety of shapes and characters, from adorable animals to playful food items, making them a favorite among collectors of all ages. Unlike generic stuffed toys, Jellycats have a distinct charm—whether it’s their floppy limbs, endearing expressions, or the sheer huggability that makes them hard to put down. They’ve gained a cult following not just for their cuteness but also for their luxurious feel, often described as “the softest plush you’ll ever touch.” Whether you’re looking for a comforting bedtime companion or just another plushie to add to your growing collection, Jellycats have a way of sneaking into your heart (and onto your shelves).</p>

<h3 id="origin-of-jellycats">Origin of jellycats</h3>

<p>Jellycat was founded in London in 1999 by brothers Thomas and William Gatacre, who wanted to create plush toys that were both irresistibly soft and uniquely quirky. The brand’s unusual name came from a child’s playful mashup of two favorite things—jelly and cats—setting the tone for the whimsical and imaginative designs that followed. From the beginning, the Gatacre brothers focused on quality and creativity, crafting plushies that felt luxurious and looked delightfully different from typical stuffed toys. Their early designs featured playful textures, floppy limbs, and unexpected characters, breaking away from the traditional teddy bear mold. As demand grew, Jellycat expanded its lineup with more charming and eccentric plushies, turning a small passion project into a global phenomenon loved by collectors of all ages.</p>

<p>While tacos, burritos, and nachos are everywhere, true authentic Mexican food in Singapore is much more than just Tex-Mex flavors and a side of guacamole. From rich, slow-cooked mole to fresh ceviche and handmade tortillas, iconic Mexican food dishes are complex, vibrant, and—unfortunately—not always easy to track down here. But don’t worry, whether you’re hunting for the best Mexican restaurants in Singapore, searching for Mexican food near me, or craving Mexican food delivery in Singapore, there are options if you know where to look. So, is Singapore finally getting the Mexican food scene it deserves? Still far from it but getting there.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-authentic-mexican-food">What is authentic Mexican food?</h3>

<p>Authentic Mexican food is a rich and diverse cuisine rooted in indigenous Mesoamerican traditions, later influenced by Spanish colonization. It features bold flavors, fresh ingredients, and traditional cooking techniques like slow-roasting, stone-grinding, and hand-pressing tortillas. Staples include corn, beans, chili peppers, and herbs like cilantro and epazote, with iconic dishes such as tacos al pastor, mole poblano, tamales, and chiles en nogada. Unlike Tex-Mex, which leans heavily on cheddar cheese, sour cream, and flour tortillas, authentic Mexican food prioritizes fresh salsas, handmade tortillas, and balanced spice. True Mexican cuisine is about vibrant, complex flavors that showcase regional diversity, from the seafood-rich dishes of Baja California to the barbacoa traditions of central Mexico. Singapore mexican food is a lot closer to Tex-Mex but there’s a spectrum of authenticity. We’ll get there.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-authentic-mexican-food-in-singapore">Why is it so hard to find authentic Mexican food in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Authentic Mexican food is hard to find in Singapore because it’s just not that popular—yet. Unlike Japanese or Korean cuisine, which have massive followings, Mexican food hasn’t quite hit the mainstream here. Many restaurants lean toward Tex-Mex, serving cheese-heavy burritos and hard-shell tacos instead of true Mexican flavors. Another challenge is the price range—authentic Mexican food should be available from cheap street-style tacos to high-end dining, but in Singapore, it’s often skewed toward the pricier side due to imported ingredients and niche demand. Plus, with relatively few South American people here to make / order the food, finding truly authentic Mexican food in Singapore is even trickier.</p>

More often than your Grab driver during surge pricing, and usually on time—unless there’s a track fault.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for the latest Singapore MRT schedule, wondering about the Singapore MRT fare, or debating between the Singapore MRT vs bus, we’ve got you covered. We’ll also take a quick ride through Singapore MRT history, introduce you to every Singapore MRT line, highlight key stations, and even look at upcoming Singapore MRT lines. And if you’re curious about Singapore MRT payment methods, yes, you can tap in with your credit card or Apple Watch—because carrying a separate transit card is so last decade. Let’s dive in and make your Singapore train commute as smooth as possible.</p>

<h3 id="when-does-the-singapore-mrt-start-and-end">When does the Singapore MRT start and end?</h3>

<p>The Singapore MRT generally starts running around 5:30 AM and operates until about midnight. On Fridays, Saturdays, and the eve of public holidays, some lines may run slightly later, usually until 12:30 AM. First and last train times vary by station and MRT line, so it’s always a good idea to check the TransitLink SimplyGo app or the official SMRT/LTA website for exact timings. If you miss the last train, your options are limited to night buses, Grab, or paying the price for a late-night taxi ride.</p>

<h3 id="how-often-does-the-singapore-mrt-arrive">How often does the Singapore MRT arrive?</h3>

<p>The Singapore MRT typically arrives every 2 to 5 minutes during peak hours and 5 to 7 minutes during off-peak hours. Late at night or early in the morning, trains may run every 10 to 15 minutes. On weekends and public holidays, frequencies can vary slightly depending on the line and time of day. If you’re traveling on less busy lines like the Thomson-East Coast Line, expect slightly longer wait times.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-track-for-singapore-mrt-arrival-times">How do I track for Singapore MRT arrival times?</h3>

<p>You can always check real-time train arrival times on the TransitLink SimplyGo app or at MRT station screens.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-does-the-singapore-mrt-cost">How much does the Singapore MRT cost?</h3>

<p>The cost of taking the Singapore MRT depends on the distance you travel. Fares typically range from S$0.92 to S$2.17 for adults, with discounted fares for seniors, students, and people with disabilities. The fare is calculated based on the starting point and destination, with the price increasing for longer distances.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-pay-with-my-own-credit-card-or-apple-watch-or-do-i-need-a-singapore-mrt-transit-card">Can I pay with my own credit card or Apple Watch or do I need a Singapore MRT transit card?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can pay for your Singapore MRT ride with your own credit card or Apple Watch—no need for a separate MRT transit card like the EZ-Link or NETS FlashPay. Thanks to the SimplyGo system, you can link your credit card or Apple Pay account and tap in and out directly at the MRT gates. This contactless payment method makes it super convenient, especially if you’re not a fan of carrying around extra cards. Just make sure your card or device is compatible with SimplyGo before you hop on.</p>

<h3 id="when-was-the-singapore-mrt-constructed">When was the Singapore MRT constructed?</h3>

<p>The Singapore MRT was officially constructed in 1983, with the first line, the North-South Line (NSL), opening in 1987. This marked the beginning of Singapore’s ambitious plan to create a world-class public transport system. The project was designed to reduce road congestion and provide an efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly mode of transportation for the growing city-state. Since then, the MRT network has expanded significantly, with new lines and extensions making it one of the most advanced urban rail systems in the world.</p>

<h3 id="what-lines-are-upcoming">What lines are upcoming?</h3>

<p>Here are the upcoming Singapore MRT lines set to expand the city’s already impressive rail network:</p>

<p><u>Jurong Region Line (Pink)<u></u></u></p>

<ul>
  <li>Opening: 2027 (estimated)</li>
  <li>This line will connect Choa Chu Kang to Jurong East, enhancing access to the western regions and improving connections to Jurong Industrial Estate and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).</li>

  <li>Opening: 2029 (estimated)</li>
  <li>The Cross Island Line will stretch from Jurong Lake District to Changi (via East Coast Park), connecting key locations like Bukit Timah, Tampines, and Pasir Ris, providing a vital east-west link.</li>
</ul>

<p>These new lines will further boost connectivity across Singapore, ensuring the MRT system continues to meet the needs of a growing, modern city.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-take-the-mrt-on-the-bus">Should I take the MRT on the bus?</h3>

<p>The question of whether you should take the MRT or the bus really depends on a few things: where you’re going, how much time you have, and whether you’re in the mood for an adventure. If you’re heading somewhere on the MRT, it’s usually the faster, more reliable option—especially during peak hours, when buses might get stuck in traffic. The MRT is direct, air-conditioned, and mostly on time, offering quicker connections to key spots across the city. On the other hand, if you’re in no rush and prefer scenic views or if you’re traveling somewhere without an MRT station nearby, the bus could be your better choice. Just keep in mind that buses can be a little more unpredictable, but hey, they come with a more personal touch—like making new friends during rush hour.</p>
