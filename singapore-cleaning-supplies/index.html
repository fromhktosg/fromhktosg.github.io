				<p>Looking for the best cleaning supplies in Singapore? Whether you’re stocking up on household cleaning products, sourcing wholesale cleaning supplies, or finding the right cleaning equipment supplier in Singapore for your business, this guide has you covered. From eco-friendly cleaning products to disinfectant sprays and commercial cleaning supplies, we explore the top places to buy cleaning products in Singapore—all with convenience, affordability, and hygiene in mind.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-buy-cleaning-products-locally">Where to Buy Cleaning Products Locally</h2>

<p>Singapore offers a wide range of physical stores where you can find reliable cleaning products for homes and businesses. Supermarkets like <strong>NTUC FairPrice</strong>, <strong>Cold Storage</strong>, and <strong>Giant</strong> carry an extensive selection of household cleaning essentials, from dishwashing liquids and floor cleaners to disinfectants and sponges. These chains are conveniently located across the island and regularly stock both local and international brands.
For those looking for more affordable options, <strong>Value Dollar (Valu$)</strong> stores and <strong>Daiso</strong> offer budget-friendly cleaning tools and basic products at lower prices. These are ideal for everyday use or topping up supplies without overspending.
If you’re seeking specialty or professional-grade cleaning items, shops like <strong>Selffix DIY</strong>, <strong>Home-Fix</strong>, and <strong>HardwareCity</strong> carry a variety of industrial-strength products, stain removers, and cleaning equipment such as steam cleaners and extension mops. These stores cater to both DIY homeowners and small cleaning businesses.
Wet markets and neighbourhood provision shops also sell everyday cleaning staples, including bleach, detergent, and multi-purpose sprays. While the selection might be smaller, these outlets offer convenience for quick top-ups, especially in heartland areas.</p>

<h2 id="online-stores-and-marketplaces">Online Stores and Marketplaces</h2>

<p>Shopping for cleaning products online in Singapore has become increasingly popular, thanks to the convenience of browsing, comparing, and ordering from the comfort of home. Platforms like <strong>Shopee</strong> and <strong>Lazada</strong> feature a vast array of cleaning items, from well-known household brands to niche and imported products that may not be available in physical stores.</p>

<p><strong>RedMart</strong>, the online grocery arm of Lazada, is a go-to choice for customers looking to stock up on essentials like detergents, floor cleaners, toilet bowl gels, and microfiber cloths. It often includes same-day or next-day delivery options, making it suitable for urgent restocks.</p>

<p>For businesses or bulk buyers, platforms like <strong>Qoo10</strong> and <strong>Amazon.sg</strong> offer deals on multi-pack cleaning items and industrial-grade solutions. These sites are also useful for sourcing from third-party sellers with direct manufacturer listings.
When shopping online, it’s important to read customer reviews and check product ratings to ensure authenticity and effectiveness. Comparing prices across different platforms can also help you identify discounts, bundle deals, or vouchers for first-time buyers.</p>

<h2 id="best-options-for-bulk-and-wholesale-purchases">Best Options for Bulk and Wholesale Purchases</h2>

<p>For businesses, cleaning services, or large households looking to save on cost, bulk purchasing is a practical solution. Singapore has a number of dedicated wholesalers and suppliers that cater specifically to bulk cleaning product needs.</p>

<p><strong>Peh Hardware &amp; Trading</strong>, <strong>Chai Huat Hin</strong>, and <strong>Teck Cheong Hardware</strong> are long-standing wholesale distributors offering industrial-sized detergents, sanitizers, and floor care solutions. These suppliers often deal directly with manufacturers, allowing for better pricing on large-volume orders.</p>

<p><strong>MTrade Singapore</strong> and <strong>Lazada Business</strong> are also gaining traction as B2B-friendly platforms, providing access to wholesale quantities of everyday cleaning products such as mops, pails, disinfectants, and garbage bags. Their websites typically offer custom invoicing, GST-inclusive pricing, and delivery to commercial addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Mega discount stores</strong> like <strong>Song Cho</strong> and <strong>ToTT Store</strong> occasionally offer bulk-buy deals on higher-end cleaning tools such as stainless-steel scrubbers, refillable spray bottles, and squeegees—especially useful for offices or serviced apartments.</p>

<p>It’s common for businesses to set up recurring supply arrangements or contracts with these suppliers, ensuring steady stock levels and potential cost savings through negotiated rates.</p>

<h2 id="eco-friendly-and-sustainable-product-choices">Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Product Choices</h2>

<p>The demand for eco-friendly cleaning products in Singapore has grown significantly, driven by greater environmental awareness and health concerns. Many consumers are now actively seeking alternatives that are biodegradable, non-toxic, and packaged with sustainability in mind.</p>

<p>Brands such as <strong>Ecover</strong>, <strong>Seventh Generation</strong>, and <strong>Method</strong> are widely available at larger supermarkets like Cold Storage and online platforms like RedMart and Shopee. These products are made using plant-based ingredients and are often certified cruelty-free and environmentally safe.</p>

<p>Local startups and eco-conscious businesses have also entered the market. <strong>SimplyGood</strong>, for example, offers refillable cleaning tablets that reduce plastic waste and carbon emissions associated with shipping liquids. <strong>The Sustainability Project</strong> and <strong>UnPackt</strong> are zero-waste stores that encourage customers to bring their own containers and refill cleaning liquids like floor cleaner and dishwashing soap.</p>

<p>Eco-friendly cleaning tools are also becoming more accessible. Reusable sponges, bamboo brushes, and washable microfiber cloths are available at lifestyle stores such as <strong>Scoop Wholefoods</strong> and <strong>Green Collective</strong>, as well as online.</p>

<p>These green options cater not only to households with sensitive skin or allergies, but also to consumers who want to reduce their environmental footprint without compromising on cleaning performance.</p>

<h2 id="essential-cleaning-tools-and-equipment">Essential Cleaning Tools and Equipment</h2>

<p>Having the right cleaning tools can make a significant difference in maintaining hygiene and efficiency, whether at home or in the office. In Singapore, a wide range of basic and advanced cleaning equipment is readily available across supermarkets, hardware stores, and e-commerce platforms.</p>

<p>For everyday floor cleaning, <strong>microfiber mops</strong>, <strong>spin mops</strong>, and <strong>flat mops</strong> are widely used. Popular options include <strong>Scotch-Brite</strong>, <strong>3M</strong>, and <strong>Vileda</strong>, which are known for their durability and ease of use. Some models come with built-in wringers or self-cleaning systems for convenience.</p>

<p>Vacuum cleaners are a staple in most households and offices. Compact cordless models from <strong>Dyson</strong>, <strong>Xiaomi</strong>, and <strong>Philips</strong> are common for residential use, while larger upright or wet-dry models from <strong>Kärcher</strong>, <strong>Electrolux</strong>, and <strong>Bosch</strong> are favored for commercial settings. Robot vacuum cleaners are also becoming increasingly popular for their automated convenience.</p>

<p>Scrubbers and brushes come in various forms—from handheld grout brushes to electric spin scrubbers that help tackle stubborn stains on tiles and glass. These are available at DIY stores like <strong>Selffix</strong> and general retailers like <strong>IKEA</strong> and <strong>ToTT</strong>.</p>

<p>Additional tools like dustpans, squeegees, buckets, and microfiber cloths are essentials found in every cleaning kit. High-quality, ergonomic versions of these tools are preferred for long-term use and better results.</p>

<h2 id="products-for-specific-needs-and-spaces">Products for Specific Needs and Spaces</h2>

<p>Different areas of the home or workplace require targeted cleaning products to achieve optimal results. Using the right product for each surface not only ensures cleanliness but also helps preserve materials and extend their lifespan.</p>

<p><strong>Bathroom cleaning</strong> calls for strong disinfectants and anti-mould solutions. Popular products include bleach-based toilet cleaners, mildew removers, and descaling agents from brands like <strong>Domex</strong>, <strong>Duck</strong>, and <strong>Clorox</strong>. For shower areas and tile grout, scrubbing creams and anti-slip floor cleaners are widely used.</p>

<p><strong>Kitchen surfaces</strong> benefit from degreasers and food-safe sprays that cut through oil without leaving harmful residues. Brands such as <strong>Cif</strong>, <strong>Mr Muscle</strong>, and <strong>Magiclean</strong> offer multi-surface kitchen sprays that work well on countertops, stovetops, and sinks. For ovens and exhaust hoods, foam-based degreasers are especially effective.</p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>glass and mirrors</strong>, streak-free sprays and microfiber cloths provide a polished finish. <strong>Windex</strong>, <strong>Magiclean Glass Cleaner</strong>, and vinegar-based alternatives are popular choices for windows and bathroom mirrors.</p>

<p><strong>Electronics and screens</strong> require delicate handling. Alcohol-free screen wipes and compressed air cans are ideal for laptops, phones, and keyboards. Products from <strong>Whoosh!</strong>, <strong>3M</strong>, and <strong>Screen Mom</strong> are designed for this purpose and help prevent damage from harsh chemicals.</p>

<p><strong>Upholstery and fabric surfaces</strong> demand specialized stain removers and fabric-safe sprays. Foam-based fabric cleaners from <strong>Scotchgard</strong> or enzyme-based sprays are suitable for sofas, car seats, and mattresses, while lint rollers and pet hair brushes help with daily upkeep.</p>

<h2 id="tips-for-choosing-the-right-products">Tips for Choosing the Right Products</h2>

<p>Selecting the right cleaning products starts with understanding your specific needs, whether you’re shopping for a small home, a shared household, or a business space. Consider the frequency of cleaning, the types of surfaces you deal with, and any allergies or sensitivities among users.</p>

<p>For families with young children or pets, non-toxic and fragrance-free options are ideal. Look for certifications such as hypoallergenic, plant-based, or dermatologist-tested. These products reduce the risk of skin irritation and respiratory issues, especially in enclosed spaces.</p>

<p>If you’re on a tight budget, buying in bulk or choosing multipurpose cleaners can be more economical. Brands that offer refill packs or concentrate versions help cut down on packaging costs while extending product lifespan. Check unit pricing on shelves or online listings to compare true value.</p>

<p>Effectiveness matters just as much as safety. Review product labels for active ingredients that target specific problems like grease, mold, or bacteria. Online reviews and star ratings can also provide insight into real-world performance, especially on local platforms like Shopee or Qoo10.</p>

<p>Storage space is another factor. Compact apartments may benefit from smaller bottles or all-in-one tools, while larger homes can accommodate more specialized equipment. Look for stackable containers, collapsible tools, or wall-mounted holders to stay organized.</p>

<p>Always patch-test new products on a small area before full application, especially on sensitive surfaces like marble, wood, or electronics. This ensures compatibility and avoids permanent damage.
Happy cleaning!</p>
