				<p>In my previous post, we delved into the world of Singapore’s finest grocery stores and supermarkets.</p>

<p>But let’s face it, in this age of technological marvels, even the simplest tasks have evolved. Many of us have embraced the convenience of online grocery shopping, making our lives even more hassle-free. Let’s embark on a journey to uncover the top online grocery options that Singapore has to offer for all us lazy people.</p>

<h4 id="why-shop-for-groceries-online">Why shop for groceries online?</h4>

<p>TL;DR - we’re lazy. To expand -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convenience: Shop from the comfort of your home, avoiding the need to travel to physical stores, stand in lines, or carry heavy bags. Many online grocery stores operate 24/7, providing the flexibility to shop whenever it’s most convenient for you, whether that’s early in the morning or late at night</li>
  <li>Time-saving: Quickly browse and select items, eliminating the need for a time-consuming trip to the store</li>
  <li>Price comparison: Compare prices easily across different brands and products, helping you find the best deals and discounts</li>
  <li>Subscription services: Schedule recurring deliveries for essential items, ensuring you never run out of household staples</li>
  <li>Detailed product information: Online platforms provide detailed product descriptions and customer reviews, helping you make informed decisions about the products you purchase</li>
  <li>Reduced Impulse Buying: Shopping online can help you stick to your shopping list and avoid impulse purchases, ultimately saving you money</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="are-prices-better-online">Are prices better online?</h4>

<p>Yes and no. It really depends on the quantity of goods you are purchasing. Online platforms usually have discount codes and incentivize bulk buying. However, you have to factor in whether delivery fees are high (if not waived at all).</p>

<h4 id="cons-of-online-grocery-shopping">Cons of online grocery shopping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Grocery shopping is a lifestyle: To some, grocery shopping in stores is a borderline hobby. It is for me at least. I love visiting grocery stores to see what latest products are being featured. Shopping online just isn’t the same</li>
  <li>Delivery Fees: Many online grocery platforms charge delivery fees, which can vary based on factors like the order amount, delivery time, and location. You should factor in these fees when comparing prices.</li>
  <li>Minimum Order Requirements: Some online grocery stores may require a minimum order amount to qualify for free or reduced delivery fees. Be sure to check the terms and conditions.</li>
  <li>Quality and Freshness: Some individuals prefer to select their own fresh produce and items with a specific expiration date in physical stores to ensure quality. When shopping online, you are relying on the shopper’s judgment.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-are-the-delivery-options">What are the delivery options?</h4>

<p>Let’s take a look at the top 3 grocers in Singapore - Fairprice, Sheng Shiong and Cold Storage.</p>
