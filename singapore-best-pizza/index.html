				<p>Lately, it seems like pizza stores are popping up in Singapore faster than you can say “extra cheese,” leaving us to wonder if there’s a secret competition for who can make the most authentic Neapolitan pie.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a fan of the thin, crisp New York-style slice or the soft, pillowy crust of Neapolitan pizza, there’s no shortage of options. But what exactly makes a good Neapolitan pizza? Is it the perfect char on the crust, the right balance of toppings, or just sheer pizza magic? In this article, we’ll dive into the different types of Neapolitan pizzas, explore what defines a truly exceptional slice, and share where to get the best pizzas in Singapore (yes, even if you think pizza’s just a delivery convenience). So, get ready to loosen your belt—good pizza in Singapore doesn’t come cheap, but it sure does come delicious.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-so-many-pizza-stores-opening-up-in-singapore-lately">Why are so many pizza stores opening up in Singapore lately?</h3>

<p>Well, it seems that Singapore’s love affair with pizza is reaching new heights, and it’s hard to blame them when the city has become a hub for all things trendy—and yes, pizza fits right in. With an increasing demand for more authentic, diverse, and Instagram-worthy food options, pizza shops are capitalizing on our collective desire for quality (and photogenic) pies. Add in the influence of global food trends, where Neapolitan and New York-style pizzas have taken over social media feeds, and you’ve got a recipe for more pizza than we can shake a slice at. Combine that with Singapore’s obsession with dining out and trying the latest culinary trends, and it’s no surprise that pizza joints are popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. Let’s face it: in a food-obsessed city like this, pizza is the perfect dish to keep us coming back for more.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-pizza-stores">Types of pizza stores</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Neapolitan Pizza – Authentic, thin-crust pizzas with simple, high-quality ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella di bufala. Expect a wood-fired oven and a touch of char.</li>
  <li>New York-Style Pizza – Large, foldable slices with a thin, crispy crust, typically served with a variety of classic toppings and sometimes a hefty amount of grease (yum).</li>
  <li>Roman-Style Pizza – Known for its crispy, cracker-like thin crust and square shape. This one’s all about precision in the bake.</li>
  <li>Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza – If you’re into pizza that doubles as a casserole, this is your slice. Thick, buttery crust and layers of gooey cheese and sauce—essentially, pizza lasagna.</li>
  <li>Sicilian Pizza – Square or rectangular slices with a thick, fluffy crust and toppings that are often piled on a little more generously than other styles.</li>
  <li>Artisanal Pizza – These pizza places are all about experimentation with unique toppings, gourmet ingredients, and sometimes unconventional crusts, making every pizza an art piece.</li>
  <li>Japanese/Korean Fusion Pizza – Think teriyaki chicken, kimchi, or even raw salmon on your pizza, with crusts ranging from thin to chewy, giving you an adventurous take on pizza that’s a little more umami than usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my eyes, nothing is better than a good neapolitan pizza. Let’s break it down.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-neapolitan-pizza">What makes a good neapolitan pizza?</h3>

<p>A truly exceptional Neapolitan pizza is about much more than just tossing toppings onto dough—it’s about the perfect balance of ingredients, technique, and tradition. Here’s what makes a good Neapolitan pizza:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Dough – It all starts with the dough. Neapolitan pizza dough should be made with just four ingredients: flour, water, salt, and yeast. The dough needs to be soft, slightly chewy, and elastic, with a thin center and a slightly thicker crust that puffs up beautifully during baking.</li>
  <li>The Crust – A good Neapolitan pizza has a puffy, airy crust with a bit of char, thanks to the high heat of a wood-fired oven. The crust should be thin but not flimsy, with a perfect balance between crispness and chewiness.</li>
  <li>San Marzano Tomatoes – The sauce should be made from high-quality San Marzano tomatoes, which are sweet, low-acid, and perfect for pizza sauce. The tomatoes are typically crushed and used without additional seasoning, letting their natural flavor shine.</li>
  <li>Mozzarella di Bufala – The cheese should be fresh mozzarella, and ideally, mozzarella di bufala (buffalo milk mozzarella) for that creamy, slightly tangy flavor. It should melt beautifully and not be overly greasy.</li>
  <li>Fresh Basil – A few fresh basil leaves scattered across the pizza after it comes out of the oven adds aromatic freshness and a slight peppery kick, complementing the rich tomato sauce and cheese.</li>
  <li>Olive Oil – A drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil before or after baking enhances the flavors and adds a rich, smooth finish to the pizza.</li>
  <li>Wood-Fired Oven – A traditional Neapolitan pizza is baked in a wood-fired oven at around 800-900°F (430-480°C). The high heat cooks the pizza in just 90 seconds, resulting in a crisp crust with slightly charred spots and a melty, bubbly center.</li>
  <li>Proper Balance of Toppings – The toppings should never overwhelm the crust. Neapolitan pizza is all about simplicity—too many toppings would ruin the delicate balance. The classic Margherita, with its tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, is the gold standard.</li>
  <li>Texture – The pizza should have a soft, pliable center that you can fold easily. When you bite into it, it should have a delicate crunch on the outer crust, with the center being tender but not soggy.</li>
  <li>No Overloading on Cheese – While cheese is essential, a Neapolitan pizza should never have too much. The cheese should melt evenly across the pizza, without pooling into greasy puddles. It’s about balance, not excess.</li>
  <li>Simplicity of Flavors – The beauty of Neapolitan pizza is its simplicity. Each ingredient should be allowed to shine, with no one flavor overpowering the others. The sauce, cheese, and basil should come together in a harmonious balance.</li>
  <li>Tradition – A true Neapolitan pizza should follow the regulations of the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN), which ensures authenticity in both the ingredients and the preparation. It’s the commitment to traditional methods that makes a good + Neapolitan pizza stand out.</li>
  <li>Serving Style – Neapolitan pizza is typically served as a whole pie, and it’s meant to be eaten immediately while it’s fresh out of the oven, so the crust remains crisp but not hard.</li>
  <li>Temperature – It should be served piping hot but not burning, with the cheese perfectly melted and the crust still crisp and slightly smoky from the wood-fired oven.</li>
  <li>Minimal Toppings – While variations exist, Neapolitan pizza is known for keeping it simple. The more classic Margherita or Marinara usually have just a few toppings—no crazy add-ins or unnecessary garnishes.</li>
  <li>Cultural Authenticity – A true Neapolitan pizza doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. It stays true to its Italian heritage, with a focus on the purity and simplicity of its ingredients, and the mastery of traditional cooking methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>When done right, a Neapolitan pizza is a thing of beauty—simple, delicious, and packed with flavor, proving that sometimes, less is more.</p>

<h3 id="what-types-of-neapolitan-pizza-are-there">What types of Neapolitan pizza are there?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Margherita – The classic Neapolitan pizza, topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
  <li>Marinara – A simple yet flavorful pizza with tomato sauce, garlic, oregano, and olive oil. No cheese, just pure, bold tomato goodness.</li>
  <li>Diavola – A spicy pizza featuring tomato sauce, mozzarella, and spicy salami (often pepperoni or a similar cured meat) for that fiery kick.</li>
  <li>Quattro Formaggi – A cheesy delight with a mix of four cheeses, typically mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmesan, and ricotta, creating a rich, creamy flavor.</li>
  <li>Capricciosa – A pizza loaded with a variety of toppings such as tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, artichokes, olives, and ham.</li>
  <li>Prosciutto e Funghi – A combination of prosciutto (Italian ham) and mushrooms on top of tomato sauce and mozzarella for a savory, earthy flavor.</li>
  <li>Napoli – Featuring tomatoes, mozzarella, anchovies, capers, and olives, this one’s for fans of salty, umami-packed toppings.</li>

<h3 id="how-much-you-should-expect-to-pay-for-a-good-pizza-in-singapore">How much you should expect to pay for a good pizza in Singapore?</h3>

<p>Expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $40+ for a good pizza in Singapore, depending on the style, restaurant, and toppings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Casual pizza spots (e.g., Extra Virgin Pizza, Anto Pizza) – $25 to $30 for a standard pizza.</li>
  <li>High-end Italian restaurants (e.g., Osteria Mozza, L’Antica Pizzeria Da Michele) – $30 to $40+ for a gourmet Neapolitan pizza.</li>
  <li>Fancy toppings (truffle, burrata, premium meats) – Add $5 to $15 per topping.</li>
  <li>Personal-sized pizzas (e.g., Wild Child Pizzette) – $25 to $28, though you might need two to feel full.</li>
  <li>Wood-fired or artisan pizzas – Typically in the $28 to $38 range.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re after an authentic Neapolitan pizza, expect to spend around $28 to $35, while a decent New York-style slice (if you can find one) is usually only sold as whole pies for $25 to $35. Cheap pizza exists, but if you want quality dough, good ingredients, and proper cooking techniques, $25 is your starting point—anything below that is probably just bread with sauce.</p>
